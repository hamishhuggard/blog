                  <p>I won the annual "best M.Sc." prize from the computer science department, and one of my examiners said it was <strong>"the best masters thesis they had seen"</strong>.</p>

                  <p>In the summer between my undergraduate and honours degrees, I worked with the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) on modelling air quality using low cost sensors.</p>
                  <p>Low-cost sensors pose a number of challenges: they are unreliable, noisy, and may require ongoing calibration. This paper explores these challenges, and evaluates several approaches to <strong>spatiotemporal modelling of air quality using the sensors</strong>.</p>
