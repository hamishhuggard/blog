                  <p>I develop an algorithm for detecting model miscalibration as a proxy for dataset shift or concept drift.</p>
                  <p>The paper is focused on biomedical applications of machine learning, as this was the original motivation and source of funding, but really it's generally applicable to deployed/online models.</p>
                  <p>This research was came out of my masters thesis. See below for more context.</p>

                  <p>My M.Sc. was funded by a scholarship form the Presicion Driven Health Partnership (PDH) and concerned figuring out when a medical ML model needs retraining.</p>
                  <p>I won the annual "best M.Sc." prize from the computer science department, and one of my examiners said it was <strong>"the best masters thesis they had seen"</strong>.</p>
                  <p>There are some unpublished ideas in here which I hope to return to at some point.</p>

                  <p>In the summer between my undergraduate and honours degrees, I worked with the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) on modelling air quality using low cost sensors.</p>
                  <p>Low-cost sensors pose a number of challenges: they are unreliable, noisy, and may require ongoing calibration. This paper explores these challenges, and evaluates several approaches to <strong>spatiotemporal modelling of air quality using the sensors</strong>.</p>
