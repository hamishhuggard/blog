<h1>Notes from: <i>Tramping: A New Zealand History</i></h1>

Matemateonga Walkway is an old Maori trail.  

I guess "pakeha" is a lot like "pagan". It mostly means "people who are not x", where x means either Maori or Christian, respectively. But it also seems to point at one particular group, NZ Europeans, and non-Christian Europeans, respectively. So the word sort of has two meanings, where one is a strict subset of the other.

<h2>Thumbnail History of Kiwi Tramping</h2>

<!--
<blockquote>During the firt half of the nineteenth century, Maori, missionaries and early European explorers walked long distances, often carrying heavy loads. Maori usually accompanied the Europeans, showing them the way and providing food, at whcih they were particularly adept. In the North Island, they enabled Colenso to roam the ruahine Range; in the South Island the best-known Maori guide was Kehu, who made several arduous trips from Nelson to the West Coast with New Zealand Company surveyors in the 1840s. Kehu is remembered by a 2220-metre peak at the Travers Valley in Nelson Lakes aNational Park, one of the few Maori guides to have a mountain named in his honour. It serves as fitting memorial to aman whose bush skills, knowledge of the terrain and loyalty were crucial to the survival of his Pakeha companions.</blockquote> - p. 63

<h3>Maori Tramping</h3>

<p>Maori avoided alpine travel. There were many reasons for this: climbing mountains is hard, dangerous rivers, lack of food, rapidly changing weather. They also believed that maunga (mountains) were the domain of gods (atua) and hostile elves (patupaiarehe). If mountains crossing couldn't be avoided, such as to retrieve valuable pounamu (greenstone) from the South Island west coast, which couldn't be safely reached by sea, a tohunga was brought along to appease hostile supernatural elements with a karakia (prayer). The major passes of the Southern Alps are named after their European "discoverers", but they were already well trodden by Maori.</p>

<h3>1820s-30s: Missionaries</h3>

<p>In the late 1820s missionaries started travelling long distances in New Zealand, attepting quell tribal warfare by preaching Christianity. They often travelled on foot, "usually guided by Maori converts who carried their gear". So lazy hiking also has a long tenure in Aotearoa.</p>

<h3>1830s+: Surveyors Look for Land to Settle</h3>

<p>By the end of the 1830s, the New Zealand Company was employing scientists and surveyors to find land suitable for settlement. Other explorers came for the botany or adventure. Throughout the first half of the 19th Century, Maori were employed as guides and to provide food.</p>

<!--
<blockquote>During the 1830s, missionaries were among he most adventurous Europeans in New Zealand. But by the end of the decade, imminent organised European settlement attracted a new group to these shores: scientsits and surveyors employed by the New Zealand Company, a group of English businessmen orgnising large-scale emigration to the Antipodes. The new explorers were seeking land suitable for settlement. Others were motivated by their interest in science, especially botany, and by a sense of adventure.</blockquote>

<h3>1850-60s: Map Makers</h3>

<p>In the 1850s and 60s Pakeha exploration became more thorough, with mapping, documenting, and naming. Theodolites and trig stations were used for triangulation. Modern tracks were defined, and plans could be made for roads and rail routes.</p>

<p>In the 1850s-70s a bunch of artists painted the kiwi outback. One such artist was Eugene von Guerard, whose paintings of Milford Sound and Lake Wakatipu "caused a sensation" in Melbourne art circles. Here are some of his paintings:</p>

<p>In 1890s Victorian tourists from Europe and Australia started coming to Aotearoa. There was even a guidebook for tourists: <i>A Handbook for Travellers in New Zealand</i>. Around this time Aotearoa was widely known as "Maoriland", which I guess gave it a theme park vibe. Tourism was mostly limited to the North Island. </p>

<p>In 1894 Mt Cook and the volcanos of the central North Island became our first national park. </p>

<p>Both world wars were proceeded by significant growth in kiwi tramping. One of the causes was women having to do manly jobs as part of the war effort, which broke down social norms which had prevented women from tramping. War also highlighted the value of tramping: during WWII US marines trained for pacific warfare by tramping in Taurarua. It's also easy to imagine that tramping was ideal recreation for returning soldiers: it provides some continuity with army life, and walking out in nature would help with PTSD.</p>

Also, during the depression, tramping was a more fun alternative to being unemployed:
<blockquote>With 35,000 people still unemployed in the mid-1930s, vacation jobs for students were 'quite impossible to obtain'. Tramping offered [Jack] Holloway 'a low cost means of filling in the time from November to March'. He and fellow trampers 'bought the greatest quantity of the cheapest food available with all the money we had and hoped that it would be enough'.</blockquote>

<p>During the 1920s and 30s tramping clubs popped up all over the country, starting with the Taurarua Tramping Club in Wellington. It's really funny to see monochrome photos of trampers from the 1920s with flapper haircuts, newsboy caps, and worsted suits. Tramping rankled a lot of prudes back then. Rather than be swept away in rivers, women would cross wearing unskirted shorts! Oh, the impropriety! Some women went so far as to walking in riding pants, which was "thought to be shocking! If we heard a car coming we got down by the side of the road and hid." - Mona Robinson, p. 122.</p>

<p>These early tramping clubs would cut tracks, mark them with biscuit tins, build huts, and map terrain. In a nutshell, they made tramping systematic and reproducable, accessable to anyone with a decent level of fitness.</p>

<p>During the 1930s some die-hards of the tramping clubs started organising national coalitions of trampers and lobbying the government to cultivate tramping locations.</p>

However, at this period in time tramping was very much a marginal recreation:
<blockquote>Although tramping grew in popularity during the 1930s, public attitudes to trampers often remained negativer, perhaps because they  were sometimes confused with 'tramps'. [..] But where trampers chose to walk, tramps often did so because they had to. During the 1930s and earlier economic depressions [1860s gold rushes and the long depression of the 1880s], roving bands of poor men tramped between seasonal jobs</blockquote>


<!--
<blockquote>Among those was prospector William O'Leary, better known as 'Arawata Bill', who spent decades exploring the Aspiring country, wearing a three-piece suit and long gumboots, and carrying a shovel for digging river gravel - or cutting steps on glaciers. He never found riches, but that mattered little ot him.</blockquote>
-->


<h3>Post-WWII: Tramping Goes Mainstream</h3>

<p>The government started getting involved in outdoor recreation with the first Labour government of 1935. The second world war delayed progress, but in the 1950s things picked up again.</p>

<p>The government invested heavily in huts, tracks, and bridges in the 1950s and 60s, and in 1952 the National Parks Act guaranteed the best backcountry would be protected and accessable, and increased the stock of national parks from 4 to 10 over a decade. The New Zealand Forest Service and Lands and Survey Departments were created. 1960 was also the year of peak hut construction. </p>

<p>Between the 1950s and 70s, tramping transitioned from a suspicious niche activity to a part of the kiwi identity. The In 1953 Ed Hillary climbed Mt Everist. In 1960 <i>A Good Keen Man</i> became a bestseller. Environmentalism was entering the public consciousness with the publication of <i>Silent Spring</i> in 1962. During the 1940s and 50s the publisher A.H. Reed did his famous walks across the country in his 80s and wrote several books about them. (A couple of tramping clubs, in reviewing his accounts of the trips, called his approach "foolhardy".) Here's a delightful photo of A.H. Reed doing his walk:</p>

<!--
<p>The 1960s and 70s were apparetly the golden years for tramping.</p>
-->

<p>In the 1970s and 80s many long-distance tramping feats were achieved for the first time. In 1974 mid-twenties friends Jill tremain and Graeme Dingle were the first to completely traverse the southern alps. And to make it more interesting, they did it in winter! They wrote up their experience in <i>Two Against the Alps</i>, an unusually enticing title for a tramping book. In 19838-84 Rex Hendry completely the first country-length traverse of the mountains across all three islands.</p>

<h4>Post-WWII Tramping in Europe</h4>

<p>As a sidenote, parallel post-WWWII tramping booms were seen in other countries. The first national parks were created in Britain, France and Germany after WWII. Sir Norman Birkett explained the innovation: </p>

<blockquote>It is at least inevitable that after so much suffering so nobly borne it should be felt that some compensation might be found for so large a calamity, that something nobler should emerge or those who had endureed so much, tha there should in the somewhat wistful phrase - a better world.</blockquote>

<h3>1990s Onward: Modern Tramping Takes Shape</h3>

<p>The 1984 Labour government (the Rogernomics one), while reorganising the state machinery, combined the Lands and Survey, the Forest Service, the Wildlife Service, and misc, into the Department of Conservation (DOC). DOC did some rebranding, which included creating the "great walks" label.</p> 

<p>In 1995 DOC began a massive effort to systematise facilities and make sure they were safe. This was a response the Cave Creek tragedy, where a DOC viewing platform collapsed and a student tramping group fell 40 meters onto rocks. Fourteen died and the few survivors were severely injured.</p>

<p>In 1988 DoC introduced a nationwide hut fee system (huts had previously had modest and diverse fees), which was controversion among tramping clubs who had voluntarily maintained tracks and huts. </p>

<p>The idea for an Aotearoa-wide trail had been kicking around since the 1960s, but in 1994 Geoff Chapple finally made it happen by founding the Te Araroa trust and using his platform as a journalist on the Sunday Star Times to rally support. Chapple kept a blog while figuring out the trail, which was one of the first blogs in New Zealand and reasonably popular. 13% of TA follows roads, 45% is in conservation lands, and the rest had to be negotiated with land owners.</p>

<p>The 1990s also saw changing relationships between Maori and land:</p>
<blockquote>DOC developed partnerships with Maori to promote cooperative management of landscapes imbued with mana and ancestral history, and also, in some instances, to provide Maori with revenue-generating opportunities on their land. Again, this reflected greater changes, as a reinvigorated Tretey of Waitangi became the mechanism by which long-alienated maori were drawn back into the economy.</blockquote>
Some "revenue-generating opportunities" were controversial as they made Maori into monopolistic landlords extracting rents from trampers.

<p>The 21st Century saw a huge influx of tourists, largely due to the Lord of the Rings movies, and kiwis became a minority in our own outback.</p>

<h2>A Quote about Harking Back to Pioneers I Wrote Down for Some Reason</h2>

<blockquote>Tramping harks back to pioneer life with traverses of tough terrain, a willingness to 'rough it' and an ability to improvise, all of which have become defining characterstics of Kiwi culture. Many twentieth-century trampers saw themselves as successors to the nineteenth century settlers: people as comfortable and competent in the bush and the montains as they were at the beach. During the Christmas holidays, all manner of people, including prime ministers, were in the hills with a pack on their back, savouring the refreshing antidte to the rush of their regular lives.</blockquote>

<h2>History of New Zealand Tramping Gear</h2>

<h3>Maori Gear</h3>

<p>Maori mostly walked barefoot, but they sometimes wore flax sandals (pararerae). A double-soled sandal (torua) could "endure several days' walk along a beach, which is so destructive to shoes". Maori interpreter Edward Shortland speculated that the sandals were invented primarily for protection from snow and speargrass (tumatakuru).</p>

<p>So did Maori develop superhumanly tough feet? No. When missionary/politician/botanist/explorer William Colenso made a pioneering crossing of the Ruahine Range in the 1840s, he said of his Maori guides 'my poor companions ... had suffered much rom their long walk with naked feet over those horrid stones and so much wading!'</p>

<p>Gear was carried in flax packs (kawe) which could carry up to 90kg. The book's description wasn't clear what they looked like, but you wore them like backpacks.</p>

<!--
	Engineer/explorer Arthur Dobson (namesake of Arthur's Pass) gave a description of the kawe, but I can't interpret his meaning. I also can't find any pictures online. But Dobson said you wear them like knap sacks, which I guess means they looked something like back packs. And they could carry up to 90kg.</p>
-->

<p>The pikau was also mentioned which is another kind of flax bag. I'm not sure how it's different from a kawe.</p>

<h3>Victorian Gear</h3>

<p>Again, the book's description was somewhat unclear, but here's my best guess of what Victorian gear was like:</p>

<p>You would roll up all your equipment, including flannels for pyjamas, in a wollen blanket, which was itself wrapped in an oiled sheet for waterproofing. The roll was called a "swag" and "could be carried vertically or across the back".</p>

<!--
<p>In the 1860s, explorers used wollen blankets which could be converted into "blanket tents". Instead of packs, explorers "rolled their equipment into a long swag, which could be carried vertically or across the back". Blankets and flannels for pyjamas were rolled into a waterproof oiled silk sheet.</p>
-->

<p>Some early Europeans also adopted kawe and paraperae. </p>

<h3>War-Era Gear</h3>

<p>Early sleeping bags imported from Wales and Norway were rare and expensive. More common was blankets and ground sheets.</p>

<p>No waterproof clothes. Just woollen singlets and jerseys.</p>

<p>The only pack was the A-frame 'kidney rotter', which might be homemade or bought. Ian Powell made his from "a second hand canvas or an old mailbag". These could be waterproofed by soaking, then painting with oil roof paint while drying. The drying action would draw in the oil paint.</p>

<p>Cooking was done with open fires and wet bush.</p>

<p>A sugar sack was often used as a swag bag, which I guess is a bag you put your swag into?</p>

<p>The book has an actual list of pack contents from a 1920s tramper:</p>

<p>Food:</p>
- Bread and butter<br/>
- Fresh and tinned meat<br/>
- Tea and sugar<br/>
- 60 grams of chocolate per day (a little more than a snickers bar, or 20% of a block)<br/>
- Rice<br/>
- A couple of onions per day<br/>
- Some apple, orange, lemon<br/>
- Dates/raisins/figs/prunes<br/>

<p>Gear uncommon now:</p>
- tomahawk<br/>
- rope and string<br/>
- candles<br/>
- billy<br/>
- acetylene lantern<br/>
- barometer<br/>
- medical brandy<br/>
- separate fork, knife, and spoon<br/>

<h3>40s and 50s</h3>

<p>In the 1940s and 50s gear, modern tramping gear was taking shape. Dehydrated vegetables were available, but expensive. Some trampers experimented with constructing their own dehydraters. "Rice, raisins, macaroni and cheese, and oatmeal" were the staples. Packs were made out of steel frames and quality leather, and often outlived their owners. Boots were also leather. Tents, sleeping bags, cameras, and bucket hats were normal.</p>

<h2>New Zealand Tramping Gear Companies</h2>

<p>MacPac was started in 1963 by Bruce McIntyre building packs in his parents garage in Christchurch. At the same time a couple of Dunediners were making outdoor clothing and sleeping bags with brandname Wilderness. MacPac and Wilderness combined to make MacPac Wilderness. In 2008 they also merged with Fairydown, which made down jackets and sleeping bags and was founded in 1920s Dunedin. Fairdown jackets and sleeping bags were used by Hillary's team for the Everest and Antarctic expeditions. Hillary also used the New Zealand-made Mountain Mule pack on Everest. Kathmandu was founded by outdoorswoman Jan Cameron and mountaineer John Pawson. The first Kathmandu store was in Australia, although the gear was manufactured in New Zealand. By 1991, Kathmandu was established as the cheaper option, with Chinese-manufactured gear, and Macpac followed suit.</p>

<h2>History of River Crossing</h2>

<p>"Maori often crossed rivers using rafts or mokihi made of bundles of flax flower stalks, but where flax was not available, they would use a log or pole." I think the idea was that they would all hold onto the pole/log/series-of-sticks to make a chain where the person exposed to the strongest current was supported by everyone else.</p>

<p>The 1938 FMC's Safety in the Mountains recommends using a rope. I guess first and last person to cross tie it around their waist. Then everyone else uses it as a rail while it's held from either side.</p>

<p>"By the 1980s, most trampers , except those  headed for trans-alpine terrain, stopped carrying ropes, and the skills for fording in this way gradually became lost."</p>

<h2>History of Track Markers</h2>

<p>Maori marked tracks with bent branches, knotted leaves (eg of flax), and rock cairns. Cairns are still in use! Sometimes tracks were concealed from rivals. Small rest areas with views were cleared.</p>

<p>European prospectors and settlers marked tracks by blazing tree bark with a tomahawke or axe.</p>

<p>From the 1940s, trampers started nailing biscuit tin lids onto bark. This started with the Taurarua Tramping Club, where one of the members knew someone who worked at the biscuit tin factory who gave them the rejected tin lids. The tins were often painted bright red, orange or yellow.</p>

<p>The New Zealand Forest service started using Permalot rectangles. Permalot is used to make Venetian blinds and is less prone to rust than biscuit tins. The most common colour was white which showed well under torchlight but disappeared in snow. The permalot also "provided audible guidance when the wind rattled it.</p>

<p>The current triangles are icosoles to make it easy to discern the direction they point, and the orange colour can easily be made out even by the colourblind. Triangles are nailed to trees with 5-6 cm of nails left protruding from the trunk, so that the triangle will still be held as the tree grows.</p>

<h2>Relatable Quotes about Tramping</h2>

<blockquote>
	Whatangarongaro he tangata, toitu he whenua hoki. <br/>
	People come and go, but the land endures.
</blockquote>
<p>- Whakatauki (Maori proverb)</p>

<blockquote>In many cultures there is a tradition of venturing into the mountains to purify the mind, to empty it of extraneous concerns and concentrate on what is essential. Sometimes this is expressed in terms of the healing properties of nature, which most of us believe we have experienced at some time or other when we return from the mountains mountains or sea refreshed, invigorated and with a sense that we can see things in proper perspective again.</blockquote>
<p>- Aat Vervoorn, <i>Mountain Solitudes</i></p>

<blockquote>To musicologist and trmper Michael Brown 'these outward bound journeys [of hiking clubs to the start of a track] represented a liminal experience, as in between phase during which people shrugged off their workplace rsonsibilities and everyday selves, but they were not trapers just yet.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>Intellectuals meeet physical demands; athletes, outdoor types and loners are committed to social groups where they are encouraged to share their views and feelings; the dependent are flung on their own resources, introverts must reveal themselves, and extrverts learn to listen; dreamers are awakened and the wayward directed. The need for struggle and adventure is born in most.</blockquote>
<p>- Don Grady, <i>Outward Bound at Anakiwa</i></p>

<blockquote>It has a strong sense of history and one can't help but get a feeling for the generations of men that must have passed through here, going back to the pioneers</blockquote>
<p>- Robbie Burton while traversing the southern alps</p>

<blockquote>Contrast will always renew us, and there can hardly be a greater contrast available than tramping. This contrast frequently comes in hard form - blisters, cold feet, wet socks, insect bites, gouges from matagouri - but gosh you've got something to moan about at work on Monday morning, and maybe you've acquired a seret pride in yoursel at facing difficulties that are not so common in Karori or Papanui.</blockquote>
<p>- Mark Pickering, <i>The Hills</i></p>

<blockquote>Track markers are of necessity a discreet breed whose mistakes are sworn at and whose skill is acknowledgesd only by grunts</blockquote>
<p>- Mark Pickering</p>

<p>On bad tramping writing:</p>
<blockquote>Trip reports are the staple genre. The best are imaginative and entertaining but they can also be predictable and pedestrian. As Kevin Pearce, who edited the Parlmerston North Tramping and Mountaineering Club newsletter during the late 1970s and early 1980s, noted, 'It was and is still common practice to describe tramping trips in strict chronological order with near equal emphasis on evertything done even if routine (tedious) rather than beginning the story with action, highlighting the highlights, describing feelings, using humour and allusion etc'.</blockquote>



<h2>Trail Poetry</h2>

<p><q>To know Papatuanuku [the land] you have to go slowly, on foot.</q> - Hone Tuwhare.</p>
<p>This line was part of Geoff Chapple's inspiration to start the Te Araroa trust.</p>

In 1958 two students died of hypothermia while tramping the Tauraruas. One was a David Patterson, who left the following poem:
<blockquote>
	<p>To look your end in the face<br/>
	In the icicled gaps of his eyes and gaze<br/>
	In the frozen stare of his skull's face,<br/>

	To see the scattered bones of your end<br/>
	Crusted with snow and to feel<br/>
	The fall of the snows of doom<br/></p>

	<p>Each flake like a hammer's stroke<br/>
	Is to feel your veins to be glaciers<br/>
	And your heart a foundered<br/>
	Iceberg</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Woah. This is of course very sad, but I also love that this poem exists. It's art with <i>stakes</i>. Patterson was also carrying Rex Fairburn's poetry collection <i>The Disadvantages of Being Dead</i>. Patterson has a retrospective collection of poems called <i>Up over alpha</i> which poet James Baxter had some nice words for.</p>

<p>Here's a delightful 1962 poem by a an anonymous tramper called <i>Girls of the hill</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
	The girls of the hills, we are, we are,<br/>
	The girls of the hills are we.<br/>
	You won't find us in a cabaret<br/>
	or sitting around in our negligee,<br/>
	We're off to the hills and far away:<br/>
	<br/>
	The girls of the hills are we.
</blockquote>
<p>There's another verse but it violates the established tempo and rhyme pattern, and doesn't meaningfully develop the theme, so I'm going to pretend it doesn't exist.</p>

<h2>tramping songs</h2>

<p>One traditional tramping song was "Tramp Yourself to Jolly Good Health", but unfortunately I can't find any details of this song. </p>

<p>Another was the <i>March of OSONZACS</i> (OSONZAC stands for Otago Section of the New Zealand Alpine Club):</p>
<blockquote>
	We're the he-men of Otago, striding down the mountain track<br/>
	With our eighty pounds of cargo stowed inside a Bergen pack;<br/>
	In the broad Otago valleys, in the land where men are men,<br/>
	We will have our camp fire rallies, and we'll sing these songs again.<br/>
	<br/>
	For we are the OSONZACS<br/>
	From the broad Otago tracks,<br/>
	Far away from home we long to roam,<br/>
	With swags upon our back.<br/>
	Yes, we are the Osonzacs,<br/>
	And we love our bulging packs,<br/>
	Shout it now out loud, for we are proud<br/>
	WE ARE THE OSONZACS
</blockquote>
<p>I imagine the verse being set to the tune of <a href="https://youtu.be/VsnZxfkkoKQ?t=9">Turkey in the Straw</a>, but the chorus doesn't fit. In fact the chorus has a pretty weird cadence to it which I struggle to set to music. I wonder if "we love our bulging packs" was intentional innuendo? If yes: hilarious.</p>

<p>Geoff Chapple, founder of the Te Araroa Trust,  wrote a song "Blue Trail Te Araroa", which I haven't been able to find online.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous Trivia</h2>

<h3>Search and rescue</h3>

<p>In the early 20th Century, the police were officially in charge of search and rescue, but didn't know much about tramping, and had to use tramping club members as shirpas. Over time, this evolved to "the police retained overall control but local volunteers, usually from tramping clubs, organised and did the actual searching".</p> 

<p>Then in the 1960s helicopters came on the scene and searching became feasible for police again. Nowdays search and rescue is conducted by LandSAR which is staffed by 2500 volunteers.</p>

<h3>National Parks</h3>

<p>National parks are an American invention! I would've thought national parks had existed in Britain for hundreds of years, but it was actually the twinkie-eaters who first bestowed the title onto Yellowstone Park in 1872.</p>

<p>Americans also invented most of the ammenities of national parks: information panels, information centers, seats at intervals along the track, park rangers who build tracks and huts.</p>

<h3>Nude Tramping</h3>

<p>Nude tramping is apparently a thing. While working on <i>Tramping: A New Zealand History</i>, one of the authors actually did a nude tramp along a mountain range. Aotearoa imported nude tramping from Germany, where it was popular in the 1920s for promoting Aryan phsyical health. Yikes. Nude tramping is cancelled.</p>

<h3>"Tramp" Etymology</h3>

<p>Speaking of Germany, the word "tramping" originally comes from the Middle Low German word "trampen", meaning "to walk heavily". "Tramp" as in "vagabond" is at least as old as the 1664. It's fairly easy to see how that leap was made. But what about "tramp" as in "slut"? Is there a missing link between "vagabond" and "slut" where "tramp" meant "prostitute"? </p>

<p>"Trample" comes from the same root as "tramp". I guessed that "stamp" was also etymologically related, but it turns out it actually come from the Old Norse "stappa" meaning "to pound in a mortar". </p>

<p>"Step", "stair", and "trap" might also be related to "tramp", but Wiktionary isn't clear on the matter. "Trap" is an oddball in that list, which Wiktionary explains thus: 'Connection to "step" is "that upon which one steps"'.</p>

<h3>Speed Tramping</h3>

<p>Another genre of tramping is "speed tramping". For example, in 1963 some members of the Wellington tramping club managed to traverse the Taurarua Range within two days. The following year it was brought down to 18 hours and 30 minutes by 20 year old Graeme Dingle who "went so hard at times that he hallucinated". Specifically, hallucinated a bear.</p>

<h3>Mystery Trains</h3>

<p>I think my favourite fact from the whole book is this: In the 1930s, New Zealand Rail devised a whacky scheme to drum up business on slow Sundays. On Sunday mornings a 'mystery train' would take passengers from a major city to the start of an undisclosed tramping track. The first one went from Auckland to the Waitakere Ranges. </p>
<blockquote>Although aimed at 'day trippers', these excursions encouraged mass participation b those unaccustomed to the more energetic overnight activities of tramping clubs, but prepared to give the new craze for outdoor walking a go.</blockquote>

<h3>Kehu</h3>

<blockquote>In the South Island the best-known Maori guide was Kehu, who made several arduous trips from Nelson to the West Coast with New Zealand Company surveyors in the 1840s. Kehu is remembered by a 2220-metre peak at the Travers Valley in Nelson Lakes aNational Park, one of the few Maori guides to have a mountain named in his honour. It serves as fitting memorial to a man whose bush skills, knowledge of the terrain and loyalty were crucial to the survival of his Pakeha companions.</blockquote> - p. 63



<h3>Why trampers are overwhelmingly pakeha</h3>

<p>A 2012 Sport and recreation New Zealand survey found: 4.8% of Maori, 4.7% of Asians, 0.4% of Pasifika, and 11.3% of Pakeha had been tramping in the past year.</p>

<p>Callie Corrigan, spokesperson for Toi Tangata, which promotes Maori fitness:</p>
<blockquote>If I were asked 'have I been tramping' for a survey I would answer 'no' but if I think about whether I've walked through bush and land, then I have - but I would never call it 'tramping'.
	The key part is connecting with whenua, with the land, and not going to tramp for tramping's sake. There was to be more of a reason why - searching or hunting for food ,perhaps, or walking the trails of our ancestors. It's never abot exercise. Physical activity is just a by-product...
	We don't join tramping clubs because that's a Pakeha construct. It's seen as a different world - some of the most successful innovations that lead Maori to be phsyically active are Maori-led, in a Maori world that connects Maori to the landscape.</blockquote>


<h3>One of the First Pakeha Long-Distance Trampers</h3>

<blockquote>Henry Williams, whose most arduous tramp occurred in 1839, following a visit to the kapiti Coast to install the young Octavius Hadfield s a missionary there. Although the two men had travelled south by ship, Williams decided to return on foot from Otaki to Tauranga, a journey of 480 kilometers through the North Island's rugged interior. The broad sandy beach to Whanganui provided easy walking and on his journey up the Whanganui River in a canoe paddled by 25 Maori, Williams found satisfaction in the scenery</blockquote>
<p>No doubt Williams would've done the TA if it existed then</p>

<h3>One of the First Pakeha Mountain Climbs</h3>

<p>Another exciting adventure was that of John Bidwill in 1839, who wanted to be the first European to scale Ngauruhoe. He was assisted by Maori guides, but they refused to set food on the sacred mountain, so he made the final ascent alone.</p>

<p>The volcano was in a minor state of eruption and was emitting a mushroom cloud of smoke. He said "Had it not been for the idea of standing whre no man ever stood before, I should certainly have given up the undertaking".</p>

<p>Of course, it's possible that someone already <i>had</i> climbed the volcano, but the feat wasn't recorded by Maori. The crater was 'the most terrific abyss I ever looked into or imagined'.</p>

<h3>The Big Cairn</h3>

"A cairn on the summit of Kaweka J, perhaps the largest in the country, was begun in the 2950s, and is now more than  metres high as members of the Heretaunga Tramping Club have added to it each year to commemorate members lost in the Second World War."

<h3>Speed Tramping to Save Lives</h3>

<p>From the 1930s to 1950s Davey Gunn ran a guided tramping business. He also one time</p>
<blockquote>Did his heroic 90-kilometre dash - by horse, boat and on foot - [in 1936] from Big Bay to the nearest phone at Hollyford Camp in an astonishing 20 hours, to raise the alarm about a plan crash. Two of the survivors lived because of his efforts.</blockquote> 
<!-- (page 152) -->

<h3>Victorian Trail Angels</h3>

Henry Russell recounts from 1860:
<blockquote>fate granted me a chanc encounter with five or six Maori chiefs, covered in frightening, tiger-pattern tattoos. They were travelling with their wives, to whome I was introduced, in reasonable English. Despite their friendly greetings and smiles, I must admit to not having been completely at ease, because of the [New Zealand] War[s]. But these were tattooed gentlemen, who offered me food and invited me to stay and learn more of their ways. I politely declined and, after warm handshakes, began the descent of the pass on its eastern side.</blockquote>

<h3>Hostile Faces don't Stop Trampers</h3>

<blockquote>Presure from recreational adventures also troubled Taranaki Maori. In an 1855 attempt to protect the maunga's tapu, they cut a 3-metre-wide swathe through the bush on the Pouakai Range, which offered the easiest route from New Plymouth to the base of Mt Taranaki. Hostile faces, carved on tree trunks along the slope, were designed to deter trampers intent on climbing the peak.</blockquote>

<h3>Tramping Chaperone</h3>

May Vossler describing her role as a chaperone for the Tararua Tramping Club in the 1920s: 
<blockquote>A chaperone was a lady selected because of her maturity, her sense of the proprieties, and her ability to curb he emthusiasm of young and virile people, and even elders on occasion.</blockquote>
