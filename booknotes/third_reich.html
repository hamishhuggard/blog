<h2>What's up with racial superiority theory?</h2>

Where did the Nazi's cuckoo theories of racial superiority come from? Did Hitler make them up? Or was it a crystilization of common German prejudice? Or were they like eugenics and communism: all Western intellectuals believed it at the time?

It turns out they were mostly contrived by a Frenchman and an Englishman: first by Count Joseph Arthur de Gobineau, a "diplomat and man of letters", and then expanded by Houston Stewart Chamberlain "one of the strangest Englishmen who ever lived" (no relation to PM Neville Chamberlain). 
<blockquote> It is probably no exaggeration to say, as I have heard more than one follower of Hitler say, that Chamberlain was the spiritual founder of the Third Reich.
...
Hypersensitive and neurotic and subject to frequent nervous breakdowns, Chamberlain was given to seeing demons who, by his own account, drove him on relentlessly to seek new fields of study and get on with his prodigious writings. One vision after another forced him to change from biology to botany to the fine arts, to music, to philosophy, to biography to history. Once, in 1896, when he was returning from Italy, the presence of a demon became so forceful that he got off the train at Gardone, shut himself up in a hotel room for eight days and, abandoning some work on music that he had contemplated, wrote feverishly on a biological thesis until he had the germ of the theme that would dominate all of his later works: race and history.</blockquote>
Chamberlain, inspired by Gobineau's book <i>Essai sur l'inégalité des races humaines</i>, ended up writing <i>Die Grundlagen des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts (The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century)</i> which became a sensation in pre-war Germany (and of course, grew in popularity from there). 

So no, Hitler didn't make the racial superiority theory up.

But why did Gobineau and Chamberlain like the Germans more than their own countrymen?

It seems that Gobineau was actually trying to prove the racial superiority of his <i>own</i> aristocratic background, and wasn't exactly identifying the superior "aryans" with Germans:
<blockquote>In the northwest, above a line running roughly along the Seine and east to Switzerland, the Aryans, though far from simon-pure, still survived as a superior race. This took in some of the French, all of the English and the Irish, the people of the Low Countries and the Rhine and Hanover, and the Scandinavians.  Gobineau seemingly excluded the bulk of the Germans, who lived to the east and southeast of his line — a fact which the Nazis glossed over when they embraced his teachings.</blockquote>

Chamberlain, however, was a Teutophile. Perhaps in a similar way to how some Westerners become Koreaphiles or Japanophiles. He was a huge fan of Wagner and ended up marrying Wagner's daughter. And after the publication of his book he became an obsequeous personal friend of the Kaiser:
<blockquote>He informed Wilhelm that he had placed his portrait in his study opposite one of Christ by Leonardo so that while he worked he often paced up and down between the countenance of his Savior and his sovereign.</blockquote>
Heh. Nice one.

However, Chamberlain may also have been somewhat misinterpreted by the Nazis:
<blockquote>And in this chapter he condemns “stupid and revolting anti-Semitism.” The Jews, he says, are not “inferior” to the Teuton, merely “different.”</blockquote>
And then again, maybe not
<blockquote>And yet as he proceeds to analyze the Jews, Chamberlain slips into the very vulgar anti-Semitism which he condemns in others and which leads, in the end, to the obscenities of Julius Streicher’s caricatures of die Jews</blockquote>


<h2>Was Hitler smart?</h2>

The first clue is that he did (mostly) terribly at school:
<blockquote>His marks in grade school had been uniformly good.  But at the Linz high school they were so poor that in the end, without obtaining the customary certificate, he was forced to transfer to the state high school at Steyr, some distance from Linz. He remained there but a short time and left before graduating. </blockquote>
Although this may have been more laziness than stupidity. Here's one teacher's description:
<blockquote>Hitler was certainly gifted, although only for particular subjects, but he lacked self-control and, to say the least, he was considered argumentive, autocratic, self-opinionated and bad-tempered, and unable to submit to school discipline. Nor was he industrious; otherwise he would have achieved much better results, gifted as he was.</blockquote>
He later claimed that he deliberately did badly at school to foil his father's plot to make a civil servant out of him when he wanted to be an artist. But that reeks of bullshit.

Between dropping out and being old enough to apply for art school, he bummed around and mooched off of his poor mum:
<blockquote>The next two or three years Hitler often described as the happiest days of his life. ... He contented himself with dreaming of his future as an artist and with idling away the pleasant days along the Danube. ...  Though the ailing widow found it difficult to make ends meet on her meager income, young Adolf declined to help out by getting a job. The idea of earning even his own living by any kind of regular employment was repulsive to him and was to remain so throughout his life.</blockquote>

But when he <i>did</i> get around to apply for art school there were two problems. The first was that he didn't meet the academic requirements. The second was that he sucked at drawing.
<blockquote>Hitler tried again the following year and this time his drawings were so poor that he was not admitted to the test.</blockquote>
His backup plan was to study architecture, but to Adolf's surprise they set the bar higher than "high-school dropout".

So does young Adolf swallow his pride, go back to school, and practice drawing three hours a day? No! He moves to Vienna and lives in squalour:
<blockquote>For the next four years he lived in flophouses or in the almost equally miserable quarters of the men's hostel at 27 Meldemannstrasse in rite Twentieth District of Vienna, near the Danube, staving off hunger by frequenting the charity soup kitchens of the city. </blockquote>
In fairness to Hitler, both have died within the last few years, so his support system is gone. And I can't help but pity the guy. Here's his own words:
<blockquote>Even today [Vienna] can arouse in me nothing but dismal thoughts. For me the name of this Phaeacial city represents five years of hardship and misery.  Five years in which I was forced to earn a living, first as a day laborer, then as a small painter; a truly meager living which never sufficed to appease even my daily hunger.
...
Hunger was then my faithful bodyguard; he never left me for a moment and partook of all I had ... My life was a continual struggle with this pitiless friend.</blockquote>
And yet. He never even attempted to find a regular job. Too proud for <i>that</i>.

So the picture we get of Hitler from his youth is of someone who is proud and may or may not have some talents, but definitely isn't <i>smart</i>. The rest of his life reinforces this pattern.
<blockquote>As we have seen, Hitler’s baric ideas were formed in his early twenties in Vienna, and we have his own word for it that he learned little after ward and altered nothing in his thinking.</blockquote>
Although it turned out that he <i>did</i> have a pretty major talent: politics. He could also write some banger speeches.

A few more examples of his idiocy:

He heavily buys into some unfounded bogus ratial theories, as discussed above.

He had "poisonous drugs he took daily on the advice of his quack physician. Dr. Morell".

Hitler also believed enthusiastically in horoscopes, as discussed below.

Hitler also bans any art which challenges him:
<blockquote>Works of art that cannot be understood but need a swollen set of instructions to prove their right to exist and find their way to neurotics who are receptive to such stupid or insolent nonsense will no longer openly reach the German nation.</blockquote>
This is actually one of Hitler's speeches which I find kinda funny and I'm tempted to go along with this making fun of pretentious artists.

Hitler doesn't know any economics or political theory:
<blockquote>There is almost nothing about economics in [Mein Kampt]. The subject bored Hitler and he never bothered to try to learn something about it beyond toying with the crackpot ideas of Gottfried Feder, the crank who was against “interest slavery.” 
What interested Hitler was political power; economics could somehow take care of itself. </blockquote>
also,
<blockquote>Perhaps he had less understanding than most [of the depression], since he was both ignorant of and uninterested in economics.</blockquote>
Which raises an interesting question: did Hitler actually understand what "socialism" meant?
<blockquote>And though the very name of the Nazi Party proclaimed it as “socialist,” Hitler was even more vague on the kind of “socialism” he envisaged for the new Germany. This is not surprising in view of a definition of a “socialist” which he gave in a speech on July 28, 1922:

Whoever is prepared to make the national cause his own to such an extent that he knows no higher ideal than the welfare of his nation; whoever has understood our great national anthem, “Deutschland ueber Alles,” to mean that nothing in the wide world surpasses in his eyes this Germany, people and land — that man is a Socialist.</blockquote>
So according to Hitler: socialist = nationalist.


What happens when an arrogant, uneducated, anti-intellectual sets the agenda for education and research?
<blockquote>To such a mindless man was now entrusted dictatorial control over German science, the public schools, the institutions of higher learning and the youth organizations.
...
Hitler’s contempt for “professors” and the intellectual academic life had peppered the pages of Mein Kampf, in which he had set down some of his ideas on education. “The whole education by a national state,” he had written, “must aim primarily not at the stuffing with mere knowledge but at building bodies which are physically healthy to the core.”
...
The German schools, from first grade through the universities, were quickly Nazified. Textbooks were hastily rewritten, curricula were changed, Mein Kampf was made — in the words of Der Deutsche Erzieher, official organ of the educators — “our infallible pedagogical guiding star” and teachers who failed to see the new light were cast out.
...
History was so falsified in the new textbooks and by the teachers in their lectures that it became ludicrous. The teaching of the "racial sciences,” exalting the Germans as the master race and the Jews as breeders of almost all the evil there was in the world, was even more so. In the University of Berlin alone, where so many great scholars had taught in the past, the new rector, a storm trooper and by profession a veterinarian, instituted twenty-five new courses in Rassenkura/e-— racial science — and by the time he had really taken the university apart he had eighty-six courses connected with his own profession.

The teaching of the natural sciences, in which Germany had been so pre-eminent for generations, deteriorated rapidly. Great teachers such as Einstein and Franck in physics, Haber, Willstaetter and Wajburg in chemistry, were fired or retired. Those who remained, many if them, were bitten by the Nazi aberrations and attempted to apply them to pure science. They began to teach what they called German physics, German chemistry, German mathematics. Indeed, in 1937 there appeared a journal called Deutsche Mathematik, and its first editorial solemnly proclaimed that any idea that mathematics could be judged nonracially carried “within itself the germs of destruction of German science.”</blockquote>
Of course a good fraction of the best German scientist and educators resigned or were forced out. But here are some quotes from professors who stayed for the ride:
<blockquote>Science, like every other human product, is racial and conditioned by blood.</blockquote> 
and
<blockquote>Modern Physics is an instrument of [world] Jewry for the destruction of Nordic science . . . True physics is the creation of the German spirit ... In fact, all European science is the fruit of Aryan, or, better, German thought.</blockquote>
and
<blockquote>Relativity theory is] directed from beginning to end toward the goal of transforming the living — that is, the non-Jewish — world of living essence, born from a mother earth and bound up with blood, and bewitching it into spectral abstraction in which all individual differences of peoples and nations, and all inner limits of the races, are lost in unreality, and in which only an unsubstantial diversity of geometric dimensions survives which produces all events out of the compulsion of its godless subjection to laws.</blockquote>
and
<blockquote>the Jew conspicuously lacks understanding for the truth . . . being in this respect in contrast to the Aryan research scientist with his careful and serious will to truth . . . Jewish physics is this a phantom and a phenomenon of degeneration of fundamental German Physics.</blockquote>
I find this stuff fascinating. It's such a different way of thinking about truth and knowledge. Bonkers of course. But it's kind of fun to imagine a fantasy world where different people experience different versions of the laws of nature based on their own characteristics.

I used to think that Hitler was a genius politician. Now I see him more as a big dummy who came to power through a combination of luck, good political instincts, and Dunning-Krueger confidence.

Should we think of Hitler as successful? On the one hand, he nearly succeeded in taking over the world and imposing his values on it. That sounds pretty impressive. But on the other hand, his values were fundamentally dumb. His ideological beliefs were demonstrably wrong and his goals didn't make any sense without those beliefs. So every success predicated on his ideology was really a failure. He failed at life so hard that he took most of Europe down with him.


<h2>Was the Nazi government actually socialist?</h2>

A lot of people think that the Nazis were communists or socialists. Which is fair enough. They've got "socialist" in the name.

But also: Nazis were fascists, and fascists are on the political right, hanging out with capitalism.

So were the Nazis communist or capitalists?

Here are some clues:

Hitler was anti-Marxist and anti-union.
<blockquote>As the Twenties neared their end, money started to flow into the Nazi Party from a few of the big Bavarian and Rhineland industrialists who were attracted by Hitler’s opposition to the Marxists and the trade unions.</blockquote>

The Nazis dissolved small to medium businesses, and legally enforced big business cartels.
<blockquote>The little businessmen, who had been one of the party’s chief supports and who expected great things from Chancellor Hitler, soon found themselves, many of them, being exterminated and forced back into the ranks of wage earners. Laws decreed in October 1937 simply dissolved all corporations with a capital under $40,000 and forbade the establishment of new ones with a capital less than $200,000. This quickly disposed of one fifth of all small business firms. On the other hand the great cartels, which even the Republic had favored, were further strengthened by the Nazis. In fact, under a law of July 15, 1933, they were made compulsory.  The Ministry of Economics was empowered to organize new compulsory cartels or order firms to join existing ones.</blockquote>

Some of the Nazis did try to be actual socialist and were removed.
<blockquote>Otto, Gregor Strasser’s brother, had fallen by the wayside. Unfortunately for him, he had taken seriously not only the word "socialist" but the word "workers" in the party’s official name of National Socialist German Workers’ Party. He had supported certain strikes of die socialist trade unions and demanded that the party come out for nationalization of industry. This of course was heresy to Hitler, who accused Otto Strasser of professing the cardinal sins of “democracy and liberty. On May 21 and 22, 1930, the Fuehrer had a showdown with his subordinate and demanded complete submission. When 0tto refused he was booted out of the party.</blockquote>

One of the Nazis supporter bases were the royalist, catholic conservatives.
<blockquote>To Hitler, a Catholic, an Austrian, a former tramp, a “national socialist,” a leader of the lower-middle-class masses, was rallied, in addition to his own followers, the support of the upper-class Protestants of the north, the conservative Junker agrarians and a number of monarchists, including, at the last minute, the former Crown Prince himself.</blockquote>

Hitler paid lip service to unions and workers:
<blockquote>The Nazi government proclaimed May Day (May 1), 1933, as a national holiday, officially named it the “Day of National Labor” and prepared to celebrate it as it had never been celebrated before. The trade- union leaders were taken in by this surprising display of friendliness toward the working class by the Nazis and enthusiastically co-operated with the government and the party in making the day a success. Labor leaders were flown to Berlin from all parts of Germany, thousands of banners were unfurled acclaiming the Nazi regime’s solidarity with the worker, and out at Tempelhof Field Goebbels prepared to stage the greatest mass demonstration Germany had ever seen. Before the massive rally, Hitler himself received the workers’ delegates, declaring, “You will see how untrue and unjust is the statement that the revolution is directed against the German workers. On the contrary.” Later in his speech to more than 100,000 workers at the airfield Hitler pronounced the motto, “Honor work and respect the worker!” and promised that May Day would be celebrated in honor of German labor “throughout the centuries.”</blockquote>
But this was just a ploy to round up and arrest the union leaders who were a political threat.
<blockquote>On May 2 the trade-union headquarters throughout the country were occupied, union funds confiscated, the unions dissolved and the leaders arrested. Many were beaten and lodged in concentration camps.</blockquote>

So on balance: the Nazis were a bit more right wing than left wing. But sometimes the Nazis would pretend to be socialist, or capitalist, or conservative, or Catholic, or bourgeouis, or middle-class, or whatever. It was all a ruse to get support, or funding, or to get people to do something. Hitler's only political ideology was gaining power for himself, and then leading Germany into conquest and extermination. And being slightly more right wing just happened to be on the path of optimal political growth. 

Also recall from above that Hitler knew no economics. So it doesn't really even make sense to call him a socialist or capitalist.

After the Nazis had control of Germany, they pursued an economic policy of... medieval serfdom! The Nazis needed a lot of labour to build all their tanks, so Germans had to work harder than ever before for less pay. And "medieval serfdom" isn't really an overstatement. Peasants were literally bound to their land!
<blockquote>The Hereditary Farm Law of September 29, 1933, was a remarkable mixture of pushing back the peasants to medieval days and of protecting them against the abuses of the modem monetary age. All farms up to 308 acres (125 hectares) which were capable of providing a decent living for a family were declared to be hereditary estates subject to the ancient laws of entailment. They could not be sold, divided, mortgaged or foreclosed for debts. Upon the death of the owner they had to be passed on to the oldest or youngest son, in accordance with local customs, or to the nearest male relative, who was obliged to provide a living and an education for his brothers and sisters until they were of age. Only an Aryan German citizen who could prove the purity of his blood back to 1800 could own such a farm. And only such a man, the law stipulated, could bear the “honored tide” Bauer, or Peasant, which he forfeited if he broke the “peasant honor code” or ceased, because of incapacity or otherwise, to actively farm.</blockquote>

Economic freedom didn't exist in Nazi Germany.
<blockquote>Buried under mountains of red tape, directed by the State as to what they could produce, how much and at what price, burdened by increasing taxation and milked by steep and never ending “special contributions” to the party, the businessmen, who had welcomed Hitler’s regime so enthusiastically because they expected it to destroy organized labor and allow an entrepreneur to practice untrammeled free enterprise, became greatly disillusioned.</blockquote>

And yet, Nazi Germany was a profitable ecosystem for big business.
<blockquote>Despite his harassed life, however, the businessman made good profits. In the heavy industries, chief beneficiaries of rearmament, increased theirs from 2 per cent in the boom year of 1926 to 6V2 per cent in 1938, the last full year of peace. Even the law limiting dividends to 6 per cent worked no hardship on the companies themselves. Just the opposite. In theory, according to the law, any amount above that had to be invested in government bonds — there was no thought of confiscation. Actually most firms reinvested in their own businesses the undistributed profits, which rose from 175 million marks in 1932 to five billion marks in 1938, a year in which the total savings in the savings banks amounted to only two billions, or less than half the undistributed profits, and in which the distributed profits in form of dividends totaled only 1,200,000,000 marks.  Besides his pleasant profits, the businessman was also cheered by the way the workers had been put in their place under Hitler. There were no more unreasonable wage demands. Actually, wages were reduced a little despite a 25 per cent rise in the cost of living. And above all, there were no costly strikes. In fact, there were no strikes at all. Such manifestations of unruliness were verboten in the Third Reich.

Deprived of his trade unions, collective bargaining and the right to strike, the German worker in the Third Reich became an industrial serf, bound to his master, the employer, much as medieval peasants had been bound to the lord of the manor. The so-called Labor Front, which in theory replaced the old trade unions, did not represent the worker. According to the law of October 24, 1934, which created it, it was “the organization of creative Germans of brain and fist.” It took in not only wage and salary earners but also the employers and members of the professions. It was in reality a vast propaganda organization and, as some workers said, a gigantic fraud. Its aim, as stated in the law, was not to protect the worker but “to create a true social and productive community of all Germans. Its task is to see that every single individual should be able ... to perform the maximum of work.”

Although millions more had jobs, the share of all German workers in the national income fell from 56.9 per cent in the depression year of 1932 to 53.6 per cent in the boom year of 1938. At the same time income from capital and business rose from 17.4 per cent of the national income to 26.6 per cent.</blockquote>


<h2>Nazi Sex Experiments</h2>

And there's one suite of experiments the Nazi scientists performed on the Russians which is... fascinating? horrific? They wanted to better understand how people froze to death, and how best to revive someone who came close. So they would strip Russian captives naked, dump them in tanks of freezing water, then monitor their vitals. In some cases they would patiently wait for the victims to freeze to death, in other cases they would remove the victim from the tank, and try some warming up method.
<blockquote>It was the worst experiment ever made. Two Russian officers were brought from the prison barracks. Rascher had them stripped and they had to go into the vat naked. Hour after hour went by, and whereas usually unconsciousness from the cold set in after sixty minutes at the latest, the two men in this case still responded fully after two and a half hours. All appeals to Rascher to put them to sleep by injection were fruitless. About the third hour one of the Russians said to the other, ‘Comrade, please tell the officer to shoot us.* The other replied that he expected no mercy from this Fascist dog. The two shook hands with a ‘Farewell, Comrade’ . . . These words were translated to Rascher by a young Pole, though in a somewhat different form. Rascher went to his office. The young Pole at once tried to chloroform the two victims, but Rascher came back at once, threatening us with his gun . . . The test lasted at least five hours before death supervened .</blockquote>
And... well...
<blockquote>In eight cases the test persons were placed between two naked women on a wide bed. The women were instructed to snuggle up to the chilled person as closely as possible. The three persons were then covered with blankets . . . 

Once the test persons regained consciousness, they never lost it again, quickly grasping their situation and nestling close to the naked bodies of the women.  The rise of body temperature then proceeded at approximately the same speed as test persons warmed by being swathed in blankets . . . An exception was formed by four test persons who practiced sexual intercourse between 86 and 89.5 degrees. In these persons, after coitus, a very swift temperature rise ensued, comparable to that achieved by means of a hot-water bath. 

Dr. Rascher found, somewhat to his surprise, that one woman warmed a frozen man faster than two women. 

I attribute this to the fact that in warming by means of one woman personal inhibitions are avoided and the woman clings more closely to the chilled person. Here too, return of full consciousness was notably rapid. In the of only one person did consciousness fail to return and only a slight degree of warming was recorded. This test person died with symptoms of a brain hemorrhage, later confirmed by autopsy. 

Summing up, this murderous hack concluded that wanning up a “chilled” man with women “proceeds very slowly” and that hot baths were more efficacious. </blockquote>
This sits so uncomfortably with me.


<h2>Hitler's Rhetoric</h2>

Imagine you're Hitler in 1944. Germany is rapidly falling to the combined forces of the rest of the world. Things look hopeless. How do you rally the troops?
<blockquote>Never in history was there a coalition like that of our enemies, composed of such heterogeneous elements with such divergent aims . . . Ultra-capitalist states on the one hand; ultra-Marxist states on the other. On the one hand a dying Empire, Britain; on the other, a colony bent upon inheritance, the United States . . . 

Each of the partners went into this coalition with the hope of realizing his political ambitions . . . America tries to become England’s heir; Russia tries to gain the Balkans . . . England tries to hold her possessions ... in the Mediterranean . . . Even now these states are at loggerheads, and he who, like a spider sitting in the middle of his web, can watch developments observes how these antagonisms grow stronger and stronger from hour to hour. 

If now we can deliver a few more blows, then at any moment this artificially bolstered common front may suddenly collapse with a gigantic clap of thunder . . . provided always that there is no weakening on the part of Germany. 

It is essential to deprive the enemy of his belief that victory is certain . .  Wars are finally decided by one side or the other recognizing that they cannot be won. We must allow no moment to pass without showing the enemy that, whatever he does, he can never reckon on [our] capitulation. Never! Never!</blockquote>
This is a stunning bit of rhetoric. Hats off to Hitler.


<h2>The Secret German Bunker</h2>

German propaganda successfully delayed German defeat by distracting Eisenhauer with a fake secret Nazi fortress in the alps of southern Bavaria and western Austria. In this fortress there was allegedly secret weapens, armament factories, guerrilla warriors. Great sci-fi premise.

<blockquote>Though bitterly criticized by Churchill and the British military chiefs for not beating the Russians to Berlin, as he easily could have done, Eisenhower and his staff at SHAEF were obsessed at this moment with the urgency of heading southeast after the junction with the Russians in order to capture the so-called National Redoubt, where it was believed Hitler was gathering his remaining forces to make a last stand in the almost impenetrable Alpine mountains of southern Bavaria and western Austria.

The “National Redoubt" was a phantom. It never existed except in the propaganda blasts of Dr. Goebbels and in the cautious minds at Eisenhower’s headquarters which had fallen for them. As early as March, SHAEF intelligence had warned Eisenhower that the Nazis were planning to make an impregnable fortress in the mountains and that Hitler himself would command its defenses from his retreat at Berchtcsgaden. The icy mountain crags were “practically impenetrable,” it said.

Here [it continued], defended by nature and by the most efficient secret weapons yet invented, the powers that have hitherto guided Germany will survive to reorganize her resurrection; here armaments will be manufactured in bombproof factories, food and equipment will be stored in vast underground caverns and a specially selected corps of young men will be trained in guerrilla warfare, so that a whole underground army can be fitted and directed to liberate Germany from the occupying forces.

It would almost seem as though the Allied Supreme Commander’s intelligence s'aff had been infiltrated by British and American mystery waiters. At any rate, this fantastic appreciation was taken seriously at SHAEF, where Eisenhower’s chief of staff, General Bedell Smith, mulled over the dread possibility “of a prolonged campaign in the Alpine area” which would take a heavy toll of American lives and prolong the war indefinitely.

This was the last time that the resourceful Dr. Goebbels succeeded in influencing the strategic course of the war by propaganda bluff. For though Adolf Hitler at first considered retiring to the Austro-Bavarian mountains near which he was born and in which he had spent most of the private hours of his life, and which he loved and where he had the only home he could call his own — on the Obcrsalzberg above Berchtesgaden— and there make a last stand, he had hesitated until it was too late.</blockquote>


<h2>Hitler's Horoscopes</h2>

After it was clear that the Germans would lose the war, Hitler and his friends were convinced that things were going to turn around because of a horoscope.
<blockquote>Physical wreck though Hitler now was, with a disastrous end staring him in the face as the Russians approached Berlin and the Western Allies overran the Reich, he and a few of his most fanatical followers, Goebbels above all, clung stubbornly to their hopes of being saved at the last minute by a miracle.

...

With such encouragement — and from a British source — they sent for two horoscopes, which were kept in the files of one of Himmler’s multitudinous “research” offices. One was the horoscope of the Fuehrer drawn up on January 30, 1933, the day he took office; the other was the horoscope of the Weimar Republic, composed by some unknown astrologer on November 9, 1918, the day of the Republic’s birth. Goebbels communicated the results of the re-examination of these two remarkable documents to Krosigk.

An amazing fact has become evident, both horoscopes predicting the outbreak of the war in 1939, the victories until 1941, and the subsequent series of reversals, with the hardest blows during the first months of 1945, particularly during the first half of April. In the second half of April we were to experience a temporary success. Then there would be stagnation until August and peace that same month. For the following three years Germany would have a hard time, but starting in 1948 she would rise again.

Fortified by Carlyle and the “amazing” predictions of the stars, Goebbels on April 6 issued a ringing appeal to the retreating troops:

The Fuehrer has declared that even in this very year a change of fortune shall come . . . The true quality of genius is its consciousness and its sure knowledge of coming change. The Fuehrer knows the exact hour of its arrival. Destiny has sent us this man so that we, in this time of great external and internal stress, shall testify to the miracle . .

Scarcely a week later, on the night of April 12, Goebbels convinced himself that “the exact hour” of the miracle had come. It had been a day of further bad news. The Americans had appeared on the Dessau-Berlin autobahn and the High Command had hastily ordered the destruction of its last two remaining powder factories, which were in the vicinity. Henceforth the German soldiers would have to get along with the ammunition at hand. Goebbels had spent the day at the headquarters of General Busse on the Oder front at Kuestrin. The General had assured him that a Russian breakthrough was impossible, that (as Goebbels the next day told Kros
*gk) he was “holding out until the British kick us in the ass.”

In the evening [Goebbels recounted] they had sat together at headquarters and he had developed his diesis that according to historical logic and justice things were bound to change, just as in the Seven Years’ War there had been the miracle of the House of Brandenburg.

“What Czarina will die this time?” an officer asked.

Goebbels did not know. But fate, he replied, “holds all sorts of possibilities.”

When the Propaganda Minister got back to Berlin late that night the center of the capital was in flames from another R.A.F. bombing. The remains of the Chancellery and the Adlon Hotel up the Wilhelmstrasse were burning. At the steps of the Propaganda Ministry, a secretary greeted Goebbels with a piece of urgent news. “Roosevelt,” he said, “is dead!”

The Minister’s face lit up, visible to all in the light of the flames from the Chancellery across the Wilhelmsplatz.

“Bring out our best champagne!” Goebbels cried. “And get me the Fuehrer on the telephone!”

Hitler was in his deep bunker across the way sitting out the bombing.  He picked up the telephone.

“My Fuehrer,” Goebbels said. “I congratulate you! Roosevelt is dead!  It is written in the stars that the second half of April will be the turning point for us. This is Friday, April the thirteenth. [It was already after midnight.] It is the turning point!”

Hitler’s reaction to the news was not recorded, though it may be imagined in view of the encouragement he had been receiving from Carlyle and the stars. But that of Goebbels was. “He was,” says his secretary, "in ecstasy.”

The fatuous Count Schwerin von Krosigk too. When Goebbels’ State Secretary phoned him that Roosevelt was dead he exclaimed — at least in his faithful diary:

This was the Angel of History! We felt its wings flutter through the room.  Was that not the turn of fortune we awaited so anxiously?

The next morning Krosigk telephoned Goebbels with his “congratulations” — he affirms it proudly in his diary — and, as if this were not enough, followed it with a letter in which he hailed Roosevelt’s death, he says, as “a divine judgment ... a gift from God.”

In this atmosphere of a lunatic asylum, with cabinet ministers long in power and educated in Europe’s ancient universities, as Krosigk and Goebbels were, grasping at the readings of the stars and rejoicing amidst the flames of the burning capital in the death of the American President as a sure sign that the Almighty would now rescue the Third Reich at the eleventh hour from impending catastrophe, the last act in Berlin was played out to its final curtain.</blockquote>


<h2>Was Hitler selfish?</h2>

Well, he never particularly exploited his position of power for material comforts or extravagent entertainments. So it seems reasonable to think he was genuinely motivated by getting Germans their desserts from racial superiority and not personally selfish. But. Was he a nationalist? (Which is really just selfishness at the level of one's country rather than oneself.) That is, did he really think "best race deserves land and dominance", or did he just think "<i>my</i> race deserves land and dominance"? If he was given overwhelming evidence that the Aryans <i>aren't</i> the master race, would he continue to fight for them regardless? It looks like the answer is: no!
<blockquote>But Hitler, his own personal fate sealed, was not interested in the continued existence of the German people, for whom he had always professed such boundless love. He told Speer:

If the war is lost, the nation will also perish. This fate is inevitable. There is no necessity to take into consideration the basis which the people will need to continue a most primitive existence. On the contrary, it will be better to destroy these things ourselves because <b>this nation will have proved to be the weaker one and the future will belong solely to the stronger eastern nation [Russia]</b>. Besides, those who will remain after the battle are only the inferior ones, for the good ones have been killed.</blockquote>
In fact, Hitler then issued the "Nero Decree": a scorched-Earth policy ordering the destruction of
<blockquote>all industrial plants, all important electrical facilities, water works, gas works, food stores and clothing stores; all bridges, all railway and communication installations, all waterways, all ships, all freight cars and all locomotives.</blockquote>
This destruction would surely have hurt the Germans more than the allies. Furthermore, the Fuehrer's secretary Bormann decreed
<blockquote>bringing the population to the center ot the Reich from both East and West, and the foreign workers and prisoners of war were to be included. These millions of people were to be sent upon their trek on foot. No provisions for their existence had been made, nor could it be carried out in view of the situation. It would have resulted in an unimaginable hunger catastrophe.</blockquote>
Fortunately Speer, to whom these instructions were given, disobeyed these orders and the allies quickly arrived.


<h2>Was Hitler happy?</h2>

If you could reincarnate as Hitler, would you? You don't get to change history, just experience life from his perspective. Taking over Europe sounds like a pretty exciting ride. But was it actually fun?

Was Hitler proud of what he achieved for Germany? Did he enjoy his work? Did he enjoy his status? 

It appears not. He spent his last day complaining that everyone, even his most loyal minions, had betrayed him. He said he had been wrong about German superiority and ordered Germany to be burned to the ground. Then he committed suicide. It sounds pretty miserable.
<blockquote>He dictated his final message and asked Below to deliver it to Keitel. He informed his Chief of OKW that the defense of Berlin was now at an end, that he was killing himself rather than surrender, that Goering and Himmler had betrayed him, and that he had named Admiral Doenitz as his successor.

He had one last word to say about the armed forces which, despite his leadership, had brought Germany to defeat. The Navy, he said, had performed superbly. The Luftwaffe had fought bravely and only Goering was responsible for its losing its initial supremacy in the war. As for the Army, the common soldiers had fought well and courageously, but the generals had failed them — and him.

The people and the armed forces [he continued] have given their all in this long and hard struggle. The sacrifice has been enormous. But my trust has been misused by many people. Disloyalty and betrayal have undermined resistance throughout the war.

It was therefore not granted to me to lead the people to victory. The Army General Staff cannot be compared with the General Staff in the First of War. Its achievements were far behind those of the fighting front.

At least the Supreme Nazi Warlord was remaining true to character to the very end. The great victories had been due to him. The defeats and final failure had been due to others— to their “disloyalty and betrayal.”

And then the parting valediction — the last recorded written words of this mad genius’s life.

The efforts and sacrifices of the German people in this war have been so great that I cannot believe that they have been in vain. The aim must still be to win territory in the East for the German people.</blockquote>


<h2>Misc Intereseting Bits</h2>

I found this passage quite shocking:
<blockquote>Many of [the S.A.'s] top leaders, beginning with its chief, Roehm, were notorious homosexual perverts. Lieutenant Edmund Heines, who led the Munich S.A., was not only a homosexual but a convicted murderer. These two and dozens of others quarreled and feuded as only men of unnatural sexual inclinations, with their peculiar jealousies, can.</blockquote>
How could Shirer add insult to injury to one of the Nazi's persecuted demographics? I expected quite a high bar of morality and sensitivity from a historian of so much suffering. Is that an unreasonable expectation?

How did Hitler fund aggressive re-armament while Germany was broke?
<blockquote>All of Schacht’s admitted wizardry in finance was put to work to pay for getting the Third Reich ready for war. Printing banknotes was merely one of his devices. He manipulated the currency with such legerdemain that at one time it was estimated by foreign economists to have 237 different values. He negotiated amazingly profitable (for Germany) barter deals with dozens of countries and to the astonishment of orthodox economists successfully demonstrated that the more you owed a country the more business you did with it. His creation of credit in a country that had little liquid capital and almost no financial reserves was the work of genius, or — as some said — of a master manipulator. His invention of the so-called “Mefo” bills was a good example. These were simply bills created by the Reichsbank and guaranteed by the State and used to pay armament manufacturers. The bills were accepted by all German banks and ultimately discounted by the Reichsbank. Since they appeared neither in the published statements of the national bank nor in the government’s budget they helped maintain secrecy as to the extent of Germany’s rearmament. From 1935 to 1938 they were used exclusively to finance rearmament and amounted to a total of twelve billion marks. In explaining them once to Hitler, Count Schwerin von Krosigk, the harassed Minister of Finance, remarked that they were merely a way of “printing money.”</blockquote>

Almost, but not quite, a nice bit of prose here from Mussolini.
<blockquote>The Duce, said the Fuehrer, was “one of those lonely men of the ages on whom history is not tested, but who themselves are the makers of history.”</blockquote>

Was WWII really Neville Chamberlain's fault?
<blockquote>Time after time, as we have seen, in 1936 when the Germans marched into the demilitarized Rhineland, in 1938 when they took Austria and threatened a European war to take the Sudetenland, even a fortnight before, when they grabbed Czechoslovakia, Great Britain and France, backed by Russia, could have taken action to stop Hitler at very little cost to themselves. But the peace-hungry Chamberlain had shied away from such moves. Not only that: he had gone out of his way, he had risked, as he said, his political career to help Adolf Hitler get what he wanted in the neighboring lands. He had done nothing to save the independence of Austria. He had consorted with the German dictator to destroy the independence of Czechoslovakia, the only truly democratic nation on Germany’s eastern borders and the only one which was a friend of the West and which supported the League of Nations and the idea of collective security. He had not even considered the military value to the West of Czechoslovakia’s thirty-five well-trained, well-armed divisions entrenched behind their strong mountain fortifications at a time when Britain could put only two divisions in France and when the German Army was incapable of fighting on two fronts and, according to the German generals, even incapable of penetrating the Czech defenses.</blockquote>

An interesting insight into Mussolini's psychology:
<blockquote>The Italian dictator was, as the records now make clear, striving for peace because he was not ready for war. But his role greatly disturbed him. “I leave you to imagine,” he declared to Hitler in this last of the exchange of messages on August 26, “my state of mind in finding myself compelled by forces beyond my control not to afford you real solidarity at the moment of action.” Ciano noted in his diary after this busy day that “the Duce is really out of his wits. His military instinct and his sense of honor were leading him to war. Reason has now stopped him. But this hurts him very much . . . Now he has had to confront the hard truth. And this, for the Duce, is a great blow.”</blockquote>

Ciano, Mussolini's son-in-law, said this:
<blockquote>The Duce is fascinated by Hitler, a fascination which involves something deeply rooted in his make-up.</blockquote>
Shirer adds:
<blockquote>It might be said that the attraction was mutual, for the same mysterious reasons. Disloyal as he had been to of his closest associates, a number of whom he had had murdered, such as Roehm and Strasser, Hitler maintained a strange and unusual loyalty to his ridiculous Italian partner that did not weaken, that indeed was strengthened when adversity and then disaster overtook the strutting, sawdust Roman Caesar. It is one of the interesting paradoxes of this narrative.</blockquote>

Poignant:
<blockquote>Somewhere along the line, incidentally, the plan for the conquest of the Netherlands, which had been dropped from Fall Gelb in revision on October 29, 1939, was reinstated on November 14 at the urging of the Luftwaffe, which wanted the Dutch airfields for use again Britain and which offered to supply a large batch of airborne troops for this minor but somewhat complicated operation. <b>On such considerations are the fates of little nations sometimes decided</b>.</blockquote>

A rule of politics: when aggressing, make sure to muddy the water by claiming "they started it":
<blockquote>On May 3 he put it off until May 6 on account of the weather but perhaps also in part because the Foreign Office didn’t think his proposed justification for violating the neutrality of Belgium and Holland was good enough. The next day he set May 7 as X Day and on the following day postponed it again until Wednesday, May 8. “Fuehrer has finished justification for Case Yellow,” Jodi noted. Belgium and the Netherlands were to be accused of having acted most <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfsl8_o4VKc">unneutrally</a>.</blockquote>

Why didn't Germany actually invade Britain?
<blockquote>In truth neither Hitler, the High Command nor the general staffs of the Army, Navy and Air Force had ever seriously considered how a war with Great Britain could be fought and won. Now in the midsummer of 1940 they did not know what to do with their glittering success; they had no plans and scarcely any will for exploiting the greatest military victories in the history of their soldiering nation. This is one of the great paradoxes of the Third Reich. At the very moment when Hitler stood at the zenith of Ins military power, with most of the European Continent at his feet, his victorious armies stretched from the Pyrenees to the Arctic Circle, from the Atlantic to beyond the Vistula, rested now and ready for further action, he had no idea how to go on and bring the war to a victorious conclusion. Nor had his generals, twelve of whom now bandied field marshals’ batons. 

There is, of course, a reason for this, although it was not clear to us at the time. The Germans, despite their vaunted military talents, lacked any grand strategic concept. Their horizons were limited — they had always been limited — to land warfare against the neighboring nations on the European Continent. <b>Hitler himself had a horror of the sea</b> and his great captains almost a total ignorance of it. They were land-minded, not sea-minded. And though their armies could have crushed in a week the feeble land forces of Britain if they had only been able to come to grips with them, even the narrow waters of the Dover Straits which separated the two — so narrow that you can see across to the opposite shore — loomed in their minds, as the splendid summer began to wane, as an obstacle they knew not how to overcome.</blockquote>

What would have happened if Germany <i>had</i> invaded Britain?
<blockquote>Had the invasion been attempted the Germans would not have been received gently by the British. Churchill later confessed that he had often wondered what would have happened. Of this much he was certain:

The massacre would have been on both sides grim and great. There would have been neither mercy nor quarter. They would have used terror, and we were prepared to go all lengths.

He does not say specifically to what lengths, but Peter Fleming in his book on Sea Lion gives one of them. The British had decided, he says, as a last resort and if all other conventional methods of defense failed, to attack the German beachheads with mustard gas, sprayed from low-flying airplanes. It was a painful decision, taken not without much soul searching at the highest level; and as Fleming comments, the decision was “surrounded by secrecy at the time and ever since.”</blockquote>

Here's another nightmare from the concentration camps:
<blockquote>In this train [transporting Eastern concentration camps labourers] women gave birth to babies who were thrown out of the windows during the journey.</blockquote>

Italians are more civilized than Germans (?)
<blockquote>So fell, ignominiously, the modern Roman Caesar, a bellicose-sounding man of the twentieth century who had known how to profit from its confusions and despair, but who underneath the gaudy facade was made largely of sawdust. As a person he was not unintelligent. He had read widely in history and thought he understood its lessons. But as dictator he had made the fatal mistake of seeking to make a martial, imperial Great Power of a country which lacked the industrial resources to become <b>one and whose people, unlike the Germans, were too civilized, too sophisticated, too down to earth to be attracted by such false ambitions. The Italian people, at heart, had never, like the Germans, embraced fascism. They had merely suffered it</b>, knowing that it was a passing phase, and Mussolini toward the end seems to have realized this. But like all dictators he was carried away by power, which, as it inevitably must, corrupted him, corroding his mind and poisoning his judgment. This led him to his second fatal mistake of tying his fortunes and those of Italy to the Third Reich. When the bell began to toll for Hitler’s Germany it began to toll for Mussolini’s Italy, and as the summer of 1 943 came the Italian leader heard it. But there was nothing he could do to escape his fate. By now he was a prisoner of Hitler.</blockquote>

One of the most fascinating things I learned from this book: in 1943 Mussolini was deposed and imprisoned at the Campo Imperatore. The new Italian government declared war on Germany, so the Germans intook down the new government, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Sasso_raid">heisted</a> Mussolini out of prison in a dinky little plane. Mussolini was then put back in power, but by this point his position as Hitler's puppet was pretty clear.

Hitler is bad at naming things.
<blockquote>Hitler wanted to call his book “Four and a Half Years of Struggle against Lies, Stupidity and Cowardice,” but Max Amann, the hard-headed manager of the Nazi publishing business, who was to bring it out, rebelled against such a ponderous — and unsalable — title and shortened it to My Struggle (Mein Kampf).</blockquote>

Why didn't anyone see the third reich coming when Hitler literally laid out his plan in <i>Mein Kampf</i>?
<blockquote>It might be argued that had more non-Nazi Germans read it before 1933 and had the foreign statesmen, of the world perused it carefully while there still was time, both Germany and the world might have been saved from catastrophe. For whatever other accusations can be made against Adolf Hitler, no one can accuse him of not {Hitting down in writing exactly the kind of Germany he intended to make if he ever came to power and the kind of world he meant to create by armed German conquest. The blueprint of the Third Reich and, what is more, of the barbaric New Order which Hitler inflicted on conquered Europe in the triumphant years between 1939 and 1945 is set down in all its appalling crudity at great length and in detail between the covers of this revealing book.</blockquote>
