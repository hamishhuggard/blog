<h1>Notes on <i>The Complete Essays of Michelle de Montaigne</i></h1>

I now have approximately one million quotations from the essays. I precede each quote with a condensation of what I found noteworthy about it.

You won't believe what this French woman did üò±üò±
<blockquote>Who has not heard at Paris of her that caused her face to be flayed only for the fresher complexion of a new skin?</blockquote>

If spending money hurts when poor, it'll still hurt when rich. When money becomes purely symbolic you can be attached and protective of the symbol.
<blockquote>I got little or no advantage from this; though I had more means for spending, it weighed no less heavily on me. For, as Bion used to say, <b>the man with hair is as angry as the bald man if you pull one out</b>. And once you are accustomed to a certain pile and set your fancy on it, it is no longer at your service: you wouldn‚Äôt dare to make a dent in it. It is a building which seems to you ready to crumble altogether at a touch.  Necessity must take you by the throat before you will cut into it.</blockquote>

Plato asserted that good health is better than good money. As someone with good health and bad money, I find this comforting. I've heard this sentiment elsewhere (Jordan Peterson?), so it even seems plausible.
<blockquote>Plato ranks corporal or human goods in this order: health, beauty, strength, riches.</blockquote>

Feeling good about having money (or health) isn't passive: to feel esteem and security, you should actively work on extracting these feelings.
<blockquote>Thus ease and indigence depend on each mans opinion; and neither riches, glory, nor health has any more beauty and pleasure than its possessor lends it. Each man is as well or as badly off as he thinks he is. Not the man of whom it is thought, but the one who thinks it of himself, is happy. And by just this fact belief gains reality and truth.</blockquote>

Before any travel, Montaigne considered what to do in case he died.
<blockquote>Someone, looking through my tablets the other day, found a memorandum about something I wanted done after my death. I told him what was true, that although only a league away from my house, and hale and hearty, I had hastened to write it there, since I could not be certain of reaching home. Since I am constantly brooding over my thoughts and settling them within me, I am at all times about as well prepared as I can be. And the coming of death will teach me nothing new. </blockquote>

Courage and intention are more important than longevity.
<blockquote><b>The advantage of living is not measured by length, but by use</b>; some men have lived long, and lived little; attend to it while you are in it. It lies in your will, not in the number of years, for you to have lived enough. Did you think you would never arrive where you never ceased going?</blockquote>

If you study insanity hard enough you go insane.
<blockquote>Gallus Vibius strained his mind so hard to understand the essence and impulses of insanity that he dragged his judgment off its seat and never could get it back again; and he could boast of having become mad through wisdom. </blockquote>

Only the healthy can withstand with medicine.
<blockquote>I reply to those who urge me to take medicine that they should wait at least until I am restored to my strength and health, so that I may have more resources to withstand the impact and the hazards of their potion.</blockquote>

If everyone knows that you know when they're plotting, then you don't need to actually know when they're plotting. Corollary: if you're sufficiently mysterious you can make money by setting up this theatre of deception.
<blockquote>A stranger stated and proclaimed everywhere that he could teach Dionysius, tyrant of Syracuse, a way to smell out and reveal with complete certainty any machinations of his subjects against him if he would give him a good sum of money. Dionysius, being informed of this, had the man summoned to enlighten him about an art so necessary to his preservation. This stranger told him that there was no art except this: that Dionysius should have one talent delivered to him and should boast of having learned from him a singular secret. Dionysius found this device good, and had six hundred crowns counted out to him. It was not likely that he would have given so great a sum to an unknown man except as a reward for learning something very useful; and this notion served to keep his enemies in fear. </blockquote>

Advertise your successes but hide your methods to surround yourself in an aura of competence.
<blockquote>Therefore princes are wise to publish the information they receive about plots that are set up against their lives, so as to make people believe that they are well informed, and that nothing can be undertaken that they do not get wind of.</blockquote>

This dramatised Archimedes is a fantastic character.
<blockquote>Just as they tell of that geometrician of Syracuse that having been diverted from his contemplation to put some of it into practice for the defense of his country, he immediately put into operation frightful machines and eifects surpassing all human belief, though all the while himself disdaining all this handiwork and thinking that he had thereby besmirched the dignity of his art, of which his inventions were but the apprentice work and playthings; so they, if at any time they were put to the test of action, were seen to soar on such a lofty wing that it clearly appeared that their heart and soul had been marvelously enlarged and enriched by the understanding of things. </blockquote>

Philosophers are not impressed by petty distinctions in pedigree and property. These advantages are negligible compared to simply being alive in the world.
<blockquote>Do you want to make them judge the merits of a case, the actions of a man? They are well prepared indeed. They are still trying to find out whether there is life, whether there is movement, whether man is something other than an ox, what it is to act and to be acted on, what kind of animals laws and justice are. Do they speak of the magistrate, or speak to him? They do so with an irreverent and uncivil liberty. Do they hear their prince or a king praised? He is just a shepherd to them, idle as a shepherd, occupied in milking and fleecing his flocks, but much more roughly than a shepherd. <b>Do you consider someone greater for owning two thousand acres of land? They rnock him, being accustomed to embrace the whole world as their possession. Do you boast of your nobility because you can count seven rich ancestors? They think little of you, as one not conceiving the universal image of nature or how many predecessors each of us has had: rich, poor, kings, servants, Greeks, and barbarians.</b> And though you were the fiftieth in descent from Hercules, they find you vain to make Capital of this gift of fortune. </blockquote>

Reading without writing is like eating without digesting.
<blockquote>We take the opinions and the knowledge of others into our keeping, and that is all. We must make them our own. We are just like a man who, needing fire, should go and fetch some at his neighbors house, and, having found a fine big fire there, should stop there and warm himself, forgetting to carry any back home. What good does it do us to have our belly full of meat if it is not digested, if it is not transformed into us, if it does not make us bigger and stronger?</blockquote>

Seneca cures morbidity, Cicero consoles.
<blockquote>Do I want to arm myself against the fear of death? I do so at Seneca‚Äôs expense. Do I want to draw consolation for myself or for another? I borrow it from Cicero.</blockquote>

Your writing is never as good as you imagined it, and it's disheartening to know that others have already said the same thing more eloquently. The consolations are that at least you have the ability to appreciate the superior qualities of other writers (a faculty that many lack), that you can have confidence you're on the right track, and that you're standing on your own feet and being honest.
<blockquote>As for the natural faculties that are in me, of which this book is the essay, I feel them bending under the load. My conceptions and my judgment move only by groping, staggering, stumbling, and blundering; and when I have gone ahead as far as I can, still I am not at all satisfied: I can still see country beyond, but with a dim and clouded vision, so that I cannot clearly distinguish it. And when I undertake to speak indiscriminately of everything that comes to my fancy without using any but my own natural resources, if I happen, as I often do, to come across in the good authors those same subjects I have attempted to treat‚Äîas in Plutarch I have just this very moment come across his discourse on the power of imagination‚Äîseeing myself so weak and puny, so heavy and sluggish, in comparison with those men, I hold myself in pity and disdain.

Still I am pleased at this, that my opinions have the honor of often coinciding with theirs, and that <b>at least I go the same way, though far behind them, saying ‚ÄúHow true!‚Äù</b> Also that I have this, which not everyone has, that I know the vast difference between them and me. And nonetheless I let my thoughts run on, weak and lowly as they are, as I have produced them, without plastering and sewing up the flaws that this comparison has revealed to me. One needs very strong loins to undertake to march abreast of those men. </blockquote>

The peril of quoting superior writers is that your own writing pales in comparison.
<blockquote>The undiscerning writers of our century who amid their nonexistent works scatter whole passages of the ancient authors to do themselves honor, do just the opposite. For this infinite difference in brilliance gives so pale, tarnished, and ugly an aspect to the part that is their own that they lose in this way much more than they gain. [...] I happened the other day to come upon such a passage. <b>I had dragged along languidly after French words so bloodless, fleshless, and empty of matter and sense that they really were nothing but French words.</b> At the end of a long and tedious road I came upon a bit that was sublime, rich, and lofty as the clouds. If I had found the slope gentle and the climb a bit slower, it would have been excusable; but it was a precipice so straight and steep that after the first six words I realized that I was flying off into another world. From there I saw the bog I had come out of, so low and deep that I never again had the stomach to go back down into it. </blockquote>

Don't aim to create the idealised specimen of writing. Aim to accurately describe the content of your mind.
<blockquote>Whatever these absurdities may be, I have had no intention of concealing them, any more than I would a bald and graying portrait of myself, in which the painter had drawn not a perfect face, but mine. For likewise these are my humors and opinions; I offer them as what I believe, not what is to be believed.  I aim here only at revealing myself, who will perhaps be different tomorrow, if I learn something new which changes me. I have no authority to be believed, nor do I want it, feeling myself too ill-instructed to instruct others. </blockquote>

Education should present the student with a sm√∂rg√•sbord of manners of thinking. Some of these will bounce off, but others will bring out latent elements within the student. By the end, the student shouldn't be aping anyone else, but carrying their own organic blend of beliefs and attitudes.
<blockquote>Let the tutor make his charge pass everything through a sieve and lodge nothing in his head on mere authority and trust: let not Aristotle‚Äôs principles be principles to him any more than those of the Stoics or Epicureans. Let this variety of ideas be set before him; he will choose if he can; if not, he will remain in doubt. [...] For if he embraces Xenophons and Plato‚Äôs opinions by his own reasoning, they will no longer be theirs, they will be his. [...] A He must imbibe their ways of thinking, not learn their precepts. And let him boldly forget, if he wants, where he got them, but let him know how to make them his own. Truth and reason are common to everyone, and no more belong to the man who first spoke them than to the man who says them later. It is no more according to Plato than according to me, since he and I understand and see it in the same way. A The bees plunder the flowers here and there, but afterward they make of them honey, which is all theirs; it is no longer thyme or marjoram. Even so with the pieces borrowed from others; he will transform and blend them to make a work that is all his own, to wit, his judgment. His education, work, and study aim only at forming this. </blockquote>

Montaigne also put it more poetically:
<blockquote>He who follows another follows nothing. He finds nothing; indeed he seeks nothing.</blockquote>

Be judicious in the arguments you engage in. Aim for brevity.
<blockquote>He will be taught not to enter into discussion or argument except when he sees a champion worth wrestling with, and even then not to use all the tricks that can help him, but only those that can help him most. Let him be made fastidious in choosing and sorting his arguments, and fond of pertinence, and consequently of brevity. </blockquote>

Prepare to surrender to truth as soon as you see it.
<blockquote>Let him be taught above all to surrender and throw down his arms before truth as soon as he perceives it, whether it be found in the hands of his opponents, or in himself through reconsideration.</blockquote>

To stop costly signalling, attach the signal to something low status.
<blockquote>With such a device Zaleucus corrected the corrupted manners of the Locrians. His ordinances were these: that a free woman may not be attended by more than one chambermaid except when she is drunk, nor may she go outside the city at night, or wear gold jewels about her person, or an embroidered dress, unless she is a public whore; and that except for pimps, no man is allowed to wear a gold ring on his finger, or a dainty robe of the sort made of the cloth woven in the city of Miletus. And thus, by these shameful exceptions, he ingeniously diverted his citizens from pernicious superfluities and luxuries.</blockquote>

Don't expect yourself to give the final word on any subject. Simply demonstrate how your mind interacts with it.
<blockquote>I take the first subject that chance offers. Thev are all equally good to me. And I never plan to develop them completely. For <b>I do not see the whole of anything; nor do those who promise to show it to us</b>. Of a hundred members and faces that each thing has, I take one, sometimes only to lick it, sometimes to brush the surface, sometimes to pinch it to the bone. I give it a stab, not as wide but as deep as I know how. And most often I like to take them from some unaccustomed point of view. I would venture to treat some matter thoroughly, if I knew myself less well.</blockquote>

Amusements should be joyous and work should be productive. If you're not having fun and no tangible value comes out of it then you're probably kidding yourself.
<blockquote>What sinew of his soul is not touched and employed in this silly and puerile game? I hate it and avoid it, because <b>it is not enough a game, and too serious an amusement</b>; I am ashamed to devote to it the attention that would suffice to accomplish something good.</blockquote>

The lethal entertainment cartridge.
<blockquote>Cleombrotus of Ambracia, having read Plato‚Äôs Phaedo, gained such an appetite for the life to come that, without any other reason, he went and threw himself into the sea</blockquote>

I hadn't thought much about the logic of torturing confessions out of people before, but there is both a fallacy and a logic I hadn't realised.
<blockquote>Tortures are a dangerous invention, and seem to be a test of endurance rather than of truth. Both the man who can endure them and the man who cannot endure them conceal the truth. A For why shall pain rather make me confess what is, than force me to say what is not? And on the other hand, if the man who has not done what he is accused of is patient enough to endure these torments, why shall the man who has done it not be also, when so fair a reward as life is set before him? I think that the basis of this invention rests on the consideration of the power of conscience. For the guilty man‚Äôs conscience seems to abet the torture in making him confess his fault, and to weaken him; whereas the innocent man‚Äôs conscience seems to fortify him against his torture.</blockquote>

Roman nobleman takes execution as an opportunity to learn about the mechanics of the soul.
<blockquote>Canius Julius, a Roman nobleman of singular virtue and firmness, after being condemned to death by that scoundrel Caligula, gave this among many prodigious proofs of his resoluteness. As he was on the point of being executed, a philosopher friend of his asked him: ‚ÄúWell, Canius, how stands your soul at this moment? What is it doing? What are your thoughts?‚Äù ‚ÄúI was thinking,‚Äù he replied, ‚Äúabout holding myself ready and with all my powers intent to see whether in that instant of death, so short and brief, I shall be able to perceive any dislodgment of the soul, and whether it will have any feeling of its departure; so that, if I learn anything about it, I may return later, if I can, to give the information to my friends.‚Äù This man philosophizes not only unto death, but even in death itself. What assurance it was, and what proud courage, to want his death to serve as a lesson to him, and to have leisure to think about other things in such a great business! </blockquote>

Lol.
<blockquote>Instead of blowing the childs nose, as we should, this amounts to pulling it off. </blockquote>

Montaigne, Plato, Aristotle, Thales weigh in on the best age to marry.
<blockquote>I married at thirty-three, and approve the suggestion of thirty-five, which they say is Aristotle‚Äôs. Plato does not want people to marry before thirty; but he is right to laugh at those who perform the works of marriage after fifty-five; and he condemns their offspring as unworthy of nourishment and life. Thales sets its truest limits.  When young, he answered his mother, who was urging him to marry, that it was not yet time; and, when he was getting old, that it was no longer time. We must deny that there is any appropriate time for any inappropriate action. </blockquote>

How to retire gracefully: devolve management of your affairs to you children, offer mentorship, but keep hold of the keys to castle in case any of them turn out bad. Stay close to your children, but out of the way of their festivities, living with comfort but not ostentation.
<blockquote>This is not to say that we should so obligate ourselves to our children that we can no longer retract what we give them. I, who am ready to play this role, would leave my children the enjoyment of my house and possessions, but with liberty to repent if they gave me occasion to. I would leave them the use of it because that would no longer be convenient to me; and of authority over affairs in general, I would reserve for myself as much as I pleased. For I have always judged that it must be a great contentment to an old father himself to give his children a start in managing his affairs, and during his lifetime to be able to oversee their conduct, furnishing them with instruction and advice according to the experience he has of them, directing their efforts to uphold the ancient honor and order of his house, and thereby finding firm ground for the hopes he may conceive of their future conduct.

And for this purpose I would not avoid their company; I would observe them close up, and enjoy their fun and festivities within the limitations of my age. If I did not live among them (as I could not without spoiling their gatherings by being fretful as old men are and a slave to my infirmities, and without also doing violence to the rules and ways of living that I should then have), I should at least want to live near them in a part of my house, not the most showy but the most comfortable.</blockquote>

You're books are your babies. Neither are wholey your own, but you achieve partial immmortality through both.
<blockquote>Now, to consider this simple reason for loving our children, that we have begot them, therefore calling them our second selves, it appears, methinks, that there is another kind of production proceeding from us, that is of no less recommendation: for that which we engender by the soul, the issue of our understanding, courage, and abilities, springs from nobler parts than those of the body, and that are much more our own: we are both father and mother in this generation. These cost us a great deal more and bring us more honour, if they have anything of good in them. For the value of our other children is much more theirs than ours; the share we have in them is very little; but of these all the beauty, all the grace and value, are ours; and also they more vividly represent us than the others. Plato adds, that these are immortal children that immortalise and deify their fathers, as Lycurgus, Solon, Minos. [...] And I know not whether I had not much rather have begot a very beautiful one, through society with the Muses, than by lying with my wife.</blockquote>

There are two useful kinds of non-fiction: scrupulously collected catalogues of data, and experts telling stories about how to interpret all the data. Everything in between is garbage.
<blockquote>I like historians who are either very simple or outstanding. The simple, who have not the wherewithal to mix in anything of their own, and who bring to it only the care and diligence to collect all that comes to their attention and to record everything faithfullv without choice or discrimination, leave our judgment intact to discern the truth. Such, for example, among others, is the good Froissart, who has gone along in his undertaking with such frank simplicity that having made a mistake he is not at all afraid to recognize it and correct it at the spot where he has been made aware of it; and who presents to us even the diversity of the rumors that were current and the different reports that were made to him. This is the material of history, naked and unformed; each man can make his profit of it according to his understanding.

The really outstanding ones have the capacity to choose what is worth knowing; they can pick out of two reports the one that is more likely. From the nature and humors of princes they infer their intentions and attribute appropriate words to them. They are right to assume the authoritv to regulate our belief by their own; but certainly this privilege belongs to very few people. 

Those in between (which are the commonest sort) spoil evervthing for us. They want to chew our morsels for us; they give themselves the right to judge, and consequently to slant historv to their fancy; for once the judgment leans to one side, one cannot help turning and twisting the narrative to that bias. They undertake to choose the things worth knowing, and often conceal from us a given word, a given private action, that would instruct us hetter; they omit as incredible the things they do not understand, and perhaps also some things because they do not know how to say them in good Latin or French. Let them boldly display their eloquence and their reasonings, let them judge all they like; but let them also leave us the wherewithal to judge after them, and not alter or arrange by their abridgments and selection anything of the substance of the matter, but pass it on to us pure and entire in all its dimensions. </blockquote>

Story about a magpie needed a day to process a trumped tune before being able to render it.
<blockquote>But this story of the magpie, for which we have Plutarch himself as sponsor, is strange. She was in a barber‚Äôs shop in Rome, and did wonders in imitating with her voice all that she heard. One day it happened that certain trumpeters stopped and blew a long time in front of this shop. After that and all the next day here was this magpie pensive, mute, and melancholv, at which everyone marveled, and thought that the sound of the trumpets had stunned her and deafened her, and that her voice had been snuffed out together with her hearing. But they found in the end that it was a profound study and a withdrawal within herself, while her mind was practicing and preparing her voice to represent the sound of these trumpets; so that the first voice she used was that one, expressing perfectly their runs, pitches, and variations; and for this new acquirement she abandoned and scorned all she had learned to say before. </blockquote>

When people do metaphysics they wonder aimlessly in a thousand directions.
<blockquote>A Reason does nothing but go astray in everything, and especially when it meddles with divine things. Who feels this more evidently than we? For even though we have given it certain and infallible principles, even though we light its steps with the holy lamp of the truth which it has pleased God to communicate to us, nevertheless we see daily how, when it strays however little from the beaten path and deviates or wanders from the way traced and trodden by the Church, immediately it is lost, it grows embarrassed and entangled, whirling round and floating in that vast, troubled, and undulating sea of human opinions, unbridled and aimless. As soon as it loses that great common highroad it breaks up and disperses onto a thousand different roads. Man can be only what he is, and imagine only within his reach.</blockquote>

All the wild descriptions of foreigners by Pliny and Herodotus.
<blockquote>If we want to believe Pliny and Herodotus, there are species of men in certain places who have very little resemblance to our kind. And there are half-breed and ambiguous forms between human and brutish nature. There are countries where the men are born without heads, wearing their eyes and mouth in their chest; where they are all androgynous; where they walk on all fours; where they have only one eye in their forehead, and a head more like a dogs than like ours; where thev are half fish underneath and live in the water: where the women give birth at the age of five and live only till eight; where their head and the skin of their forehead is so hard that iron cannot cut it and is blunted by it; where the men are beardless; nations without use or knowledge of fire; others that give black-colored sperm. What of those who naturally change into wolves, into mares, and then back into men? And if it is so, as Plutarch says, that in some place in the Indies there are men without mouths, feeding on the smell of certain odors, how many of our descriptions are false? </blockquote>

Montaigne mentions an interesting theological point raised by Origen:
<blockquote>at one time God was a creator without a creation; that he had been idle and then renounced his idleness and set about his work; and that in consequence he is subject to change. </blockquote>

Poetic mythology:
<blockquote>In the most famous of the Greek schools, the world is held to be a god made by another, greater god, and is composed of a body and a soul that dwells in the center of it, spreading by musical numbers to its circumference; divine, very happy, very great, very wise, eternal.  In it are other gods, the earth, the sea, the stars, which entertain each other with a perpetual harmonious agitation and divine dance, now meeting, now separating, hiding, appearing, changing order, now in front and now behind. </blockquote>

A man born blind doesn't know what he's missing and so interpolates as best he can from social cues. Is all human activity like this?
<blockquote>I have seen a gentleman of a good house, born blind, or at least blind from such an age that he does not know what sight is. He understands so little what he lacks, that he uses and employs as we do words appropriate to sight, and applies them in a manner all private and his own. He was presented with a boy, whose godfather he was; taking him in his arms, he said: ‚ÄúMy, what a handsome boy! How good it is to see him! What a gay face he has!‚Äù He will say like one of us: ‚ÄúThis room has a fine view; it is a clear day, the sun is shining bright.‚Äù There is more; for because hunting, tennis, and shooting are our sports, and he has heard this, he is fond of them and keenly interested in them, and thinks he has the same share in them that we do; he finds excitement and pleasure in them, and yet he takes them in onlv through his ears. They call to him that there goes a hare when they are in a bit of fine open country where he can spur his horse; and then they tell him later that there is a hare caught; and he is as proud of his catch as he hears the others say they are. The tennis ball he takes in his left hand and strokes with his racket; with the harquebus he shoots at random, and gets his fun by having his men tell him that he is either over or beside the mark.

 What do we know about whether mankind is doing something equally foolish for lack of some sense, and whether by this lack the greater part of the face of things is hidden from us? What do we know about whether the difficulties we find in many works of nature come from that? And whether many actions of the animals that exceed our capacity are produced by the operation of some sense that we lack?  And whether some of them have by this means a fuller and more complete life than ours? </blockquote> 

Heliogabalus had preparations made for a luxurious suicide when the time came.
<blockquote> The most effeminate man in the world, Heliogabalus, amid his laxest sensualities, indeed made plans to kill himself delicately when the occasion should force him to. And so that his death should not belie the rest of his life, he expressly had a sumptuous tower built, the base and front of which were floored with planks enriched with gold and precious stones, to throw himself from; and he also had cords of gold and crimson silk made for strangling himself, and a gold sword forged for running himself through; and he kept venom in emerald and topaz vessels for poisoning himself, according as the whim should seize him to choose from all these ways of dying: </blockquote>

Pomponius Atticus recovered from his death bed but didn't want to have to bother with dying all over again.
<blockquote>A Pomponius Atticus, the one to whom Cicero wrote letters, being sick, sent for his son-in-law Agrippa and for two or three other friends of his and told them that having found by experience that he was gaining nothing by trying to cure himself, and that all he was doing to lengthen his life was also lengthening and increasing his pain, he was determined to put an end to both; he asked them to approve of his determination, or, at worst, not to waste their pains in trying to dissuade him. Now, he chose to kill himself by abstinence, and behold his disease accidentally cured: the remedy that he had employed to do away with himself restores him to health. The doctors and his friends, celebrating such a happy result and rejoicing with him over it, found themselves much mistaken; for it was impossible for them to make him change his mind for all that. He said that one way or another he would have to cross that line some day, and that being so far advanced, he wanted to save himself the trouble of beginning all over again another time.</blockquote>

Putting down your opinions develops you as a conscious agent.
<blockquote>And if no one reads me, have I wasted my time, entertaining myself for so many idle hours with such useful and agreeable thoughts? <b>In modeling this figure upon myself, I have had to fashion and com pose myself so often to bring myself out</b>, that the model itself has to some extent grown firm and taken shape. Painting myself for others, I have painted my inward self with colors clearer than my original ones. <b>I have no more made my book than my book has made me</b>‚Äîa book consubstantial with its author, concemed with my own self, an integral part of my life; not concerned with some third-hand, extraneous purpose, like all other books. Have I wasted my time by taking stock of myself so continually, so carefully? For those who go over themselves only in their minds and occasionally in speech do not penetrate to essentials in their examination as does a man who makes that his study, his work, and his trade, who binds himself to keep an enduring account, with all his faith, with all his strength. </blockquote>

The best things in life are solitary.
<blockquote>The most delightful pleasures are digested inwardly, avoid leaving any traces, and avoid the sight not only of the public but of any other person. </blockquote>

Writing helps give your thinking structure.
<blockquote>In order to train my fancy even to dream with some order and purpose, and in order to keep it from losing its way and roving with the wind, there is nothing like embodying and registering all the little thoughts that come to it. I listen to my reveries because I have to record them.</blockquote>

Writing helps you read.
<blockquote>What if I lend a slightly more attentive ear to books, since I have been lying in wait to pilfer something from them to adorn or support my own? </blockquote>

On Homer being the greatest poet: I don't think this is at all true, but I do like the idea that poetry, like magic, is fading from the world.
<blockquote>It was against the order of nature that he created the most excellent production that can be. For things at birth are ordinarily imperfect; they gain in size and strength as they grow. He made the infancy of poetry and of several other Sciences mature, perfect, and accomplished. For this reason he may be called the first and the last of poets, according to that beautiful testimony that antiquity has left to us about him: that having had no one he could imitate before him, he has had no one after him who could imitate him. </blockquote>
Montaigne quotes Manilius here:
<blockquote>From whose abundant mouth
All later poets draw their songs as from their source, 
Draining into their rivulets his torrent‚Äôs course, 
Rich in the wealth of one.</blockquote>

Brains are nice but beauty is essential. Unfortunately relatable.
<blockquote>Moreover, I used to set great store by the mind, but only provided the body was not deficient. For, to answer in all conscience, if beauty of one or the other had necessarily to be lacking, I would have chosen sooner to give up the mental. It has its use in better things; but in the matter of love, a matter which is chiefly concerned with sight and touch, you can do something without the graces of the mind, nothing without the graces of the body. </blockquote>

Knowing yourself and that you are not your reputation will help insults from offending you.
<blockquote>As Archelaus, king of Macedonia, was passing in the street, someone poured some water on him. Those with him said he should punish the man. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut he did not pour water on me, but on the man he thought I was.‚Äù Socrates said to the man who informed him that people were speaking ill of him: ‚ÄúNot at all; there is nothing in me of what they say.‚Äù

As for me, if someone praised me for being a good pilot, for being very modest, or for being very chaste, I would owe him no thanks. And similarly if someone called me traitor, robber, or drunkard, I would consider myself offended just as little. Those who have a false opinion of themselves can feed on false approbations; not I, who see myself and search myself to my very entrails, who know well what belongs to me. I am pleased to be less praised, provided I am better known.</blockquote>

Throughout human existence, men have taken as many female partners as they could get their hands on. In many societies, social status affords more wives. But what if women had more power? How many would want to couple with as many hot guys as they could? And how many would just want to pick out one guy they particularly liked?
<blockquote>We have learned from their own mouth the proof that was once given in different centuries by an emperor and an empress [Proculus and Messalina] of Rome, master workmen and famous in this task: he indeed deflowered in one night ten captive Sarmatian virgins; but she actually in one night was good for twenty-five encounters, changing company according to her need and liking.</blockquote>

Montaigne auditioning as a True Detective screenwriter: man is shameful, as is his production.
<blockquote><b>Perhaps we are right to blame ourselves for making such a stupid production as man, to call the action shameful, and shameful the parts that are used for it.</b> [...] Everyone shuns to see a man born, everyone runs to see him die. For his destruction we seek a spacious field in broad daylight; for his construction we hide in a dark little corner. It is a duty to hide and blush in order to make him; and it is a glory and a source of many virtues to be able to unmake him. One is an offense, the other an act of grace; for Aristotle says that to benefit someone, in a certain phrase of his country, is to kill him. The Athenians, to put the disgrace of these two actions on the same level, when they had to purify the island of Delos and justify themselves to Apollo, forbade both any burial and any birth within its territory. We are ashamed of our very selves [Terence]. <b>We regard our being as vice</b>. </blockquote>

The Essenes were an ~0th Century Jewish sect who persisted several centuries despite celibacy by taking on new members. Wikipedia says that only the priestly class were celibate, which isn't as interesting.
<blockquote>The Essenes, of whom Pliny speaks, maintained their numbers for several centuries without nurses and without baby clothes, by the influx of foreigners who, following this fine humor, continually joined them: a whole nation risked exterminating itself rather than involve themselves in a womans embrace, and forfeiting the continuation of mankind rather than create a man. </blockquote>

It can be fun to read just to know the personality.
<blockquote>And every day I amuse myself reading authors without any care for their learning, looking for their style, not their subject. Just as I seek the company of some famous mind, not to have him teach me, but to come to know him. </blockquote>

I think the inverse statement is more compelling: Few can speak wisely, but anyone can speak honestly.
<blockquote>Any man may speak truly; but to speak with order, wisely, and competently, of that few men are capable. </blockquote>

Remember that your boss may find your excuses and deceptions more annoying than your mistakes.
<blockquote>I do not get excited once in a year over the mistakes of those over whom I have authority; but over the stupidity and obstinacy of their brutish and asinine assertions, excuses, and defenses, we are at each other‚Äôs throats every day. </blockquote>

Nice burn.
<blockquote>They understand neither what is said nor why, and answer accordingly.</blockquote>

Don't hold yourself, or anyone else, to an unrealistic standard.
<blockquote>Let them do less, provided they are capable of doing something.</blockquote>

At one point Montaigne makes a digression on the subject of digressions. Then he blames the reader for not being able to follow him.
<blockquote>This stuffing is a little out of my subject. I go out of my way, but rather by license than carelessness. My ideas follow one another, but sometimes it is from a distance [...] There are works of Plutarch s in which he forgets his theme, in which the treatment of his subject is found only incidentally, quite smothered in foreign matter. See his movements in ‚ÄúThe Daemon of Socrates.‚Äù Lord, what beauty there is in these lusty sallies and this variation, and more so the more casual and accidental they seem.

It is the inattentive reader who loses my subject, not I. Some word about it will always be found off in a corner, which will not fail to be sufficient, though it takes little room. I seek out change indiscriminately and tumultuously. My style and my mind alike go roaming. ‚Äú<b>A man must be a little mad if he does not want to be even more stupid</b>,‚Äù say the precepts of our masters, and even more so their examples.</blockquote>


You can save yourself work if you just do the thing and don't worry about optics.
<blockquote>I did not leave undone, as far as I know, any action that duty genuinely required of me. I easily forgot those that ambition mixes up with duty and covers with its name. Those are the ones that most often fill the eyes and ears, and satisfy men. Not the thing but the appearance pays them. If they hear no noise, it seems to them that we are asleep. </blockquote>

The translator breaks the fourth wall:
<blockquote>Montaigne‚Äôs play on words, Plaisans causeurs, is beyond my power to render. </blockquote>

Socrates' story did have a happy ending: his execution was the ideal climax to his character arc, and his persecutors were shunned.
<blockquote>Should people have heard a supplicating voice from the mouth of Socrates? Should that proud virtue have quit at the height of its display? And should his rich and powerful nature have committed his defense to art, and, in its loftiest test, renounced truth and sincerity, the ornaments of his speech, to bedeck itself with the make-up of the figures and fictions of a memorized oration? He did very wisely, and like himself, not to corrupt an incorruptible tenor of life and such a saintly model of human nature in order to prolong his decrepitude by a year and betray the immortal memory of that glorious end. He owed his life not to himself but to the world as an example. Would it not be a public loss if he had finished it in an idle and obscure fashion?

Assuredly, such a nonchalant and mild way of considering his death deserved to have posterity consider it all the more on his behalf; which it did. And there is nothing in justice so just as what fortune ordained for his glory. For the Athenians held those who had been the cause of his death in such abomination that they shunned them like excommunicated persons; they considered everything they had touched as polluted; no one would wash with them at the baths; no one greeted them or said hello to them. So that finally, no longer able to bear this public hatred, they hanged themselves.</blockquote>

If anyone needs a quote on the cover of their book, try one of these:
<blockquote>We dignify our stupidities when we put them in print.</blockquote>
<blockquote>People write just as injudiciously as they speak</blockquote>

Making an assertion more prestigious by quoting an esteemed author rather than actually making the case for it being true.
<blockquote>But is it not true that we seek rather the honor of quoting than the truth of the statement? As if it were greater to borrow our proofs from the shop of Vascosan or Plantin than from what may be seen in our own village. Or rather, indeed, that we have not the wit to pick out and put to use what happens before our eyes, and to judge it keenly enough to make it an example?</blockquote>

Apparently drinking is just a convention. The boundaries of what was plausible were different in Montaigne's time in surprising ways. As well as this drinking, Montaigne discusses the crazy descriptions of foreigners from Pliny and Herodotus as if they should be taken seriously.
<blockquote>A gentleman who has acquitted himself worthily in several charges said in my presence that he had gone from Madrid to Lisbon in midsummer without drinking.  He is in vigorous health for his age, and has nothing extraordinary in his way of living except this, that he will go two or three months, even a year, so he told me, without drinking. He feels some thirst, but he lets it pass, and maintains that it is an appetite that easily grows languid by itself; and he drinks more out of caprice than from need or for pleasure. </blockquote>

Before brushing teeth they would rub teeth with a napkin?
<blockquote>It is not the fault of my teeth, which have always been good, even excellent, and which only just now are beginning to be threatened by old age. I learned from childhood to rub them with my napkin both in the morning and before and after meals.</blockquote>

It's better to die by degrees because then you never properly die, ship of Thesius style.
<blockquote>God is merciful to those whose life he takes away bit by bit; that is the only benefit of old age. The last death will be all the less complete and painful; by then it will kill only a half or a quarter of a man.</blockquote>

Real success in life is private. Living with "order and tranquillity in our conduct". 
<blockquote>We are great fools. ‚ÄúHe has spent his life in idleness,‚Äù we say; ‚ÄúI have done nothing today.‚Äù <b>What, have you not lived? That is not only the fundamental but the most illustrious of your occupations.</b> ‚ÄúIf I had been placed in a position to manage great affairs, I would have shown what I could do.‚Äù Have you been able to think out and manage your own life? You have done the greatest task of all. To show and exploit her resources Nature has no need of fortune; she shows herself equally on all levels and behind a curtain as well as without one. To compose our character is our duty, not to compose books, and to win, not battles and provinces, but order and tranquillity in our conduct. <b>Our great and glorious masterpiece is to live appropriately. All other things, ruling, hoarding, building, are onlv little appendages and props, at most.</b> </blockquote>

Nature has given us faculties for enjoying life. Why waste them?
<blockquote>As for me, then, I love life and cultivate it just as God has been pleased to grant it to us. I do not go about wishing that it should lack the need to eat and drink, and it would seem to me no less excusable a failing to wish that need to be doubled. The wise man is the keenest searcher for natural treasures [Seneca]. Nor do I wish that we should sustain ourselves by merely putting into our mouths a little of that drug by which Epimenides took away his appetite and kept himself alive; <b>nor that we should beget children insensibly with our fingers or our heels, but rather, with due respect, that we could also beget them voluptuously with our fingers and heels</b>; nor that the body should be without desire and without titillation. Those are ungrateful and unfair complaints. I accept with all my heart and with gratitude what nature has done for me, and I am pleased with myself and proud of myself that I do. We wrong that great and all-powerful Giver by refusing his gift, nullifying it, and disfiguring it. Himself all good, he has made all things good. All things that are according to nature are worthy of esteem [Cicero]. </blockquote>

Most of the grand projects we trouble ourselves with are vacuous nonsense. We should take ourselves less seriously.
<blockquote>Come on now, just to see, some day get some man to tell you the absorbing thoughts and fancies that he takes into his head, and for the sake of which he turns his mind from a good meal and laments the time he spends on feeding himself. You will find there is nothing so insipid in all the dishes on your table as this fine entertainment of his mind (most of the time we should do better to go to sleep completely than to stay awake for what we do stay awake for); and you will find that his ideas and aspirations are not worth your stew.</blockquote>
